{"pmid":"21123691","sections":["INTRODUCTION\nOver the past 30 yr U.S. science education has repeatedly been cited as being in need of repair (\n\nNational Science Board Commission on Precollege Education in Mathematics, Science, and Technology, 1983; \n\nNational Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983; \n\nRutherford, 1990). Such characterizations have focused primarily on K–12 science education. However, criticisms of postsecondary science education in the mid- to late-1980s and throughout the 1990s have strengthened the opinion that the entire K–18+ continuum of science education is in need of serious reform (\n\nNational Science Board, 1986; \n\nNational Research Council [NRC], 1996a; \n\nNational Science Foundation, 1996; \n\nBoyer, 1998). It has been widely suggested that one solution to the present problems is to recalibrate science teaching so as to emphasize deep understanding of scientific concepts rather than acquisition of facts (e.g., \n\nTanner and Allen, 2005).\nHowever, when teaching and learning are more intimately wedded to understanding rather than fact acquisition, a particular problem arises—what counts as understanding? Many efforts to improve scientific understanding have focused on finding ways to bring students' everyday experiences to bear on scientific problems (\n\nNRC, 1999; \n\nNemirovsky et al., 2005). The difficulty with such efforts is that most scientific ideas are not closely tied to learners' everyday experiences (e.g., those associated with extremely large or small spatial and\/or temporal scales). As a result, students rely on one of two strategies (or some combination of the two) for learning. They may try to fit their experiences to the situation, which results in a narrative explanation of how a system operates or a process unfolds. Alternatively, they may make use of disconnected bits of knowledge or facts they glean from their school-based science experiences to make some sense of these systems or processes (\n\nBransford et al., 1999). Neither of these strategies involves students in making use of scientific principles in rigorous ways or in seeing the system in a way that is similar to how scientists might conceptualize them—as a complicated set of interacting and dynamic processes governed by fundamental principles. Nor does this kind of reasoning provide predictive power. Several researchers have argued that student knowledge might appear fragmented and inconsistent because it consists of weakly organized resources (\n\nMcDermott, 1991; e.g., \n\nDiSessa, 1993)—what \n\nRedish (2003) calls modular reasoning. In contrast, we want students to engage in what we call “the principled use of models,” that is, we want them to use the models presented to them in class along with fundamental principles such as conservation of energy or matter to make sense of complex processes they are studying.\nIn addition to the problem of deciding what counts as understanding, two other problems arise when teaching, learning, and understanding are set within the context of large-enrollment undergraduate science courses undergoing reform. First, how does one assess large numbers of students to determine the extent to which they have developed deep, rich, and\/or conceptual understanding of the course material in a useful and timely manner? Second, what is a reasonable taxonomy for sorting assessment items so that items that demand similar levels of principled use of models can be compared in longitudinal studies of courses undergoing change?\nThe work of our research group has been directed at these problems; the study presented here is part of a larger research program investigating teaching and learning in undergraduate science courses. In this article, we describe the development of a unique assessment taxonomy that allows biology instructors to sort assessment items according to the level of the principled use of models they demand of students for the purpose of generating descriptions of student performance and transfer of learning. We also present preliminary data arising from the application of our assessment taxonomy to the exam questions used in a large-enrollment foundational cell and molecular biology course over a 5-yr period for the purpose of studying the effects of instructional changes. More specifically we asked two research questions:\nFrom 2002–2007 (the years that immediately preceded and spanned the first three years of our project work), what level of performance with respect to models of photosynthesis and cellular respiration did instructors of a large-enrollment cells and molecules course (hereafter referred to as “Bio101”) demand of their students on multiple-choice exam questions?From 2002–2007, how did students' performance in this course change with respect to assessment items about models of photosynthesis and cellular respiration? Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and future directions for research.","BACKGROUND\nEfforts to Define Understanding in Science EducationAt the K–12 level, prominent national documents such as the NRC's National Science Education Standards (\n\nNRC, 1996b), the American Association for the Advancement of Science's (AAAS) Science for All Americans (\n\nRutherford, 1990), and AAAS's Benchmarks for Science Literacy (\n\nAAAS, 1993) have created frameworks for understanding. In all of these reform documents, understanding requires both the “integration” and the “use” of knowledge; understanding is thus conceptualized in terms of both knowledge and performances or actions.What counts as understanding at the undergraduate level, however, is more opaque than in K–12 documents. Although some college and university instructors currently look to Standards and\/or Benchmarks for guidance in aspects of their planning, assessment, and instruction, in most cases, undergraduate biology instructors are likely to seek more local ideas regarding what counts as understanding (\n\nTanner and Allen, 2002). For example, college and university biology instructors might look to statements of goals and\/or objectives in textbooks, to their previous experiences as instructors (or as students themselves), or to curricular materials from previous course instructors.One effort to address understanding specifically at the undergraduate level is the NRC report, Improving Undergraduate Instruction in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: Report of a Workshop (\n\n2003a). The focus of this document is the critical importance of “conceptual” and “functional” understanding; thus, as in K–12 documents, understanding is conceptualized in terms of both knowledge and performances—though in the university context, application of concepts or principles rather than action is used. Application, as \n\nBloom (1956) defined it, is a way of describing a learning objective. “Given a problem new to the student, he will apply the appropriate abstraction without having to be prompted as to which abstraction is correct or without having to be shown how to use it in that situation” (p. 120). This ability or practice is also referred to as transfer (cf \n\nCommittee on Developments in the Science of Learning, 2000).In another NRC publication, BIO2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists (\n\n2003b), “conceptual understanding” is also addressed. However, in this document, while the concepts that undergraduate science students should understand are listed, little attention is paid to the specific types of performances that would reveal this understanding. A similar treatment of key concepts without explicit links to performances appears in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-developed Biology Concept Framework (BCF; \n\nKhodor et al., 2004). Thus, the performances that would reveal understanding of key concepts have yet to be articulated. To assess these performances, what is required is not only a tool that measures them (e.g., \n\nSmith and Tanner, 2010), but also a framework designed to reflect student understanding that identifies and describes these key performances. What follows is a brief description of three recently developed tools and frameworks.Existing Tools and Frameworks for Assessing Student Knowledge\/PerformanceConcept Inventory Tests. Concept Inventory Tests—for example, those currently used widely in physics (\n\nHestenes et al., 1992), biology (\n\nAnderson et al., 2002), and genetics (\n\nSmith et al., 2008)—are a collection of discipline-specific assessment tools designed to allow instructors to acquire information regarding students' conceptual understanding. In most cases, the tool itself consists mainly of multiple-choice questions with each of the distractors or foils—i.e., the incorrect answers—based on well-documented misconceptions. The framework underlying these tools is based on assumptions about students, teaching, and learning consistent with conceptual change theory (\n\nPosner et al., 1982). When students select certain distractors in individual or small groups of questions, instructors have access to specific information regarding students' misconceptions. Once identified, these misconceptions can be used to inform instruction via specific types of interventions (\n\nPosner et al., 1982; \n\nStrike and Posner, 1992). Understanding is conceptualized in terms of both knowledge and practices. In the Biology Concept Inventory (BCI), for example, knowledge mainly takes the form of knowing “concepts,” and practices primarily take the form of actions like conclude, compare, identify, interpret or translate, predict, and explain (\n\nGarvin-Doxas and Klymkowsky, 2008; \n\nKlymkowsky and Garvin-Doxas, 2008).Diagnostic Question Clusters. This approach is designed to allow instructors to look specifically at students' understanding of matter, energy, systems, and scale using Diagnostic Question Clusters (DQCs). Like the BCI, the DQC group has designed an assessment tool that consists of multiple-choice questions with distractors based on patterns in student thinking (\n\nWilson et al., 2006). The DQCs also resemble the BCI, in that cluster questions ask students to take actions like predict and explain, but the main emphasis of their assessment tools—whether for photosynthesis or for cellular respiration—is to gauge students' ability to trace and conserve matter and energy in and through dynamic systems at various scales. In other words, the DQCs look at students' ability to use broader principles as opposed to the more specific concepts addressed in the BCI. While tools like the BCI and the DQCs share certain similarities in terms of how they conceptualize understanding, by foregrounding different knowledge and performances they afford instructors different views of student understanding in biology.Blooming Biology Tool. The two approaches to assessing student understanding outlined above are based on new types of multiple-choice items, in both cases developed through rigorous and recursive processes. An entirely different approach to helping instructors assess students' understanding is to offer instructors a tool for analyzing already existing assessment items. The Blooming Biology Tool (BBT; \n\nCrowe et al., 2008) uses the familiar language of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives (\n\nBloom, 1956) to classify already existing exam questions. Its framework for understanding is defined primarily by familiar Bloom categories such as knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Via the BBT's interpretation of Bloom's taxonomy, understanding assumes various “levels” and “skills.” Memorization and recall, for example, are “lower-order cognitive skills that require a minimum level of understanding,” whereas things like the application of knowledge and critical thinking are “higher-order cognitive skills that require deep conceptual understanding” (\n\nCrowe et al., 2008, p. 368). As with Concept Inventory Tests and the DQCs, understanding involves both knowledge and performances. The tool is not tied to any particular concept or topic in biology. However, because higher levels of understanding in the BBT (i.e., “deep conceptual understanding”) are tied to performances such as the “application” of knowledge, understanding is considered the product of both knowledge and performances. The BBT affords instructors a view of student performance in biology that, like the Concept Inventories and the DQCs, is sensitive to assessment challenges faced in large-enrollment courses.Assessing Understanding in Large-Enrollment Undergraduate CoursesAssessment in large-enrollment courses often aims for a workable balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency which, in most cases, results in the use of exams with items that can be computer-scored. One of the advantages of such assessments is their expediency: they can be scored and returned to students in a short period of time. In addition, the use of scoring offices or testing services found at many large institutions offers instructors additional types of feedback. Instructors, for example, can make use of basic statistical summaries provided by such services to determine the least\/most difficult questions on an exam. Instructors can also conveniently do things like view data describing the least\/most frequently chosen answers to a multiple-choice question.One response to the problem of assessing large numbers of students in courses has been to encourage instructors to include additional forms of assessment, such as the use of open-ended questions, project-based assessment, and\/or the use of student portfolios (\n\nAngelo and Cross, 1993; \n\nNRC, 1996b, \n\n2001). Another has been to increase the frequency of different types of assessment, e.g., formative assessments, during instruction (\n\nNRC, 1996b; \n\nBlack and Wiliam, 1998; \n\nYorke, 2003). Technology has also played a significant role in assessment conversations. For example, much has been reported on the use of handheld electronic devices or “clickers” as a tool for assessing student understanding (\n\nMazur, 1996; \n\nBrewer, 2004; \n\nFitch, 2004; \n\nZhang et al., 2005; \n\nCampbell and Mayer, 2006; \n\nCaldwell, 2007). Each of these approaches has its affordances and constraints. In large-enrollment science courses, time and resource constraints make the use of some modes of assessment such as open-ended questions a significant challenge.In our view, the increasing number of frameworks and tools for assessing student understanding provides undergraduate biology instructors with multiple ways of describing student understanding that mobilize a wide range of knowledge and performances; however, these existing tools\/frameworks are by no means comprehensive. Below we discuss our development and use of a new framework for assessing student understanding. Like the BBT, our framework is a taxonomic scheme for classifying multiple-choice questions. Unlike what has already been described, our tool is grounded in an underlying framework that considers the critical role that models play in science, as well as the critical role for the use of scientific principles. As such, it offers instructors a resource for assessing understanding that is grounded in the work of scientists and in the structure of the discipline.Development of a Taxonomy to Classify Assessments Based on Principled Use of ModelsVarious case studies of scientific practice have identified the construction and extension of models as one of the central tasks of scientific research (\n\nRouse, 1987; \n\nGiere, 1988; \n\nPickering, 1995). Model construction and extension is, as Pickering explains, “constitutive of scientific practice” (1995, p. 55). Such models, in turn, provide frameworks for organizing and directing subsequent research (\n\nDownes, 1992). Similar statements about the importance of models and modeling in science have been made by many scientists and scholars of science (\n\nGiere, 1988, \n\n1991, \n\n2004; \n\nGilbert, 1991; \n\nMagnani et al., 1999). Many K–12 science educators and researchers have taken up this general recognition of the importance of models in science, and one can now find an increasing number of studies that examine the use of models in K–12 classrooms (\n\nGrosslight et al., 1991; \n\nCartier, 2000a, \n\n2000b; \n\nTreagust et al., 2002; \n\nLehrer and Schauble, 2005).What counts as a model in science and in science education can be difficult to pin down (e.g., \n\nGiere, 2004). \n\nColl and Treagust (2003) recognized this problem in their discussion of the wealth of models including mental models, expressed models, public models, consensus models (including consensus science and consensus teaching models), teaching models, and scientific models. The kind of model that undergirds the assessment tool that we present here is most similar to what Coll and Treagust have called teaching models, which they define as “mental models as presented by teachers.” (See also \n\nGilbert et al., 2000.) They distinguish teaching models from both “consensus models” (i.e., ”public or expressed models made available to the scientific and teaching community“) and from “scientific models” (i.e., consensus models that are “subject to and survive rigorous experimental testing, published in scientific literature, and widely accepted by the scientific community”; \n\nColl and Treagust, 2003, p. 465). Teaching models can be viewed as pedagogically tuned simplifications or adaptations of consensus and\/or scientific models. Although they are meant to retain many of the intellectual properties of consensus or scientific models, teaching models have been recalibrated for a different audience—science students rather than scientists. An often implicit feature of teaching models is that they adhere to basic scientific principles of consistency.There is good reason to believe that such principles should be made explicit in science classrooms. The tracing and conserving of matter and energy within and between systems of differing size or scale is fundamental to the different scientific disciplines and has been emphasized by both scientists (c.f. \n\nPrigogine, 1961; \n\nSchrödinger, 1967; \n\nPrigogine and Stengers, 1984; \n\nSalthe, 1985) and science educators (c.f. \n\nLemke, 1990, \n\n1995). Perhaps nowhere in the scope of topics of introductory cell biology courses do the importance of these two principles become more apparent than in models of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. For example, tracing a variety of carbon- and oxygen-containing compounds through cells, as well as tracing energy as it is transformed from light to chemical potential energy, are crucial to developing a deep understanding of these two keystone concepts in biology. Therefore the principled use of teaching models is an important goal.It was with this notion of teaching models that we developed our assessment taxonomy. We used it to evaluate the effects of instructional changes on students' principled use of models of photosynthesis and cellular respiration during a 5-yr period. We present here both the taxonomy and the results of this study.","MATERIALS AND METHODS\nCourse ContextBio101 is a large-enrollment, three-credit, introductory cell and molecular biology course offered each semester at our university. From 2003 on the course was cotaught by the same two instructors. Before that, each of the instructors taught the course on his own—one instructor since 1991 and the other since 1996. In many ways, Bio101 is typical of introductory-level courses at other large universities. Each section of the course typically enrolls between 350 and 500 students and meets either thrice weekly for 50-min class periods or twice weekly for 75-min class periods over the course of a 15-wk semester. It has a general chemistry prerequisite, and enrollment is approximately 1600–1800 students per year. Each section is typically taught by one or two instructors (in our case two) with one graduate student in the role of a teaching assistant (TA) to manage homework assignments and assist instructors with the use of technology during lecture. There is no accompanying recitation section, and the associated two-credit laboratory course, which meets once a week for 3 hr during the semester, is not required to be taken concurrently. The course is required for all students majoring in science, including a large percentage of allied health majors. Although homework is a requirement and counted in the overall grading scheme, approximately 90% of a student's course grade comes from performance on three midterm examinations and one final exam.Development of a Classification Scheme to Delineate Question “Types”We needed a method to categorize the photosynthesis and cellular respiration multiple-choice questions used on Bio101 exams that would address both knowledge and performance dimensions. We combined a nondisciplinary-specific taxonomic scheme with the disciplinary-specific notion of teaching models. At first, we turned to existing taxonomies such as Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives (\n\nBloom, 1956) as well as to more recent taxonomies (e.g., \n\nMarzano, 2001; \n\nAnderson et al., 2001). In the end, we decided against the use of these taxonomies because of the disciplinary-specific demands created by our emphasis on teaching models. We set each of the four categories for classifying existing exam questions in relation to specific aspects of such models for photosynthesis and cellular respiration. An example of a common teaching model for photosynthesis, designed specifically for a student audience, is displayed in \n\nFigure 1.Figure 1.A teaching model for photosynthesis at the cellular level. This teaching model draws particular attention to three key concepts in photosynthesis: tracing matter (keeping track of specific elements in photosynthetic reactions), tracing energy (keeping track of energy transformations in photosynthetic reactions), and location (keeping track of where photosynthetic reactions occur in the cell).Based on our examination of this model alongside others that exist for these topics, we developed a basic four-category taxonomic classification scheme (\n\nTable 1).Table 1.Model-based taxonomy for the classification of photosynthesis assessment itemsCategoryCriteria1Not directly associated with features of the specific photosynthesis teaching model as presented2Describe or reproduce the specific model3Manipulate the photosynthesis model in context4Apply the model in situations beyond the original contextCategory 1 represents those questions that may be related to photosynthesis or cellular respiration but do not directly address a core feature of a teaching model as used by the instructors. Category 2 is reserved for questions that require students to describe or reproduce a teaching model in a form similar to that in which it was presented during instruction. In other words, this type of question makes direct use of the same set of standard representations (and\/or situations, scenarios, examples, etc.) that were used, for instance, in the lectures and\/or in the homework assignments. In Category 3, students are required to infer the logical conclusions of variations (modifications) of a teaching model presented in the question. In other words, they manipulate a model. The model in question, however, is still primarily in a form similar to that in which it was presented during instruction. Finally, Category 4 is reserved for those questions that require students to apply a teaching model (and may also include a manipulation) to a problem beyond the original contextual or instructional boundaries.","RESULTS\nApplying the Taxonomy to the 2002–2007 Exam QuestionsWe applied the taxonomy to all photosynthesis and cellular respiration multiple-choice questions used on midterm and final exams between 2002 and 2007. The questions from years 2006 and 2007 had each been used during the 2002–2005 period, resulting in 149 exam questions to be rated. Five raters (the two course instructors, two science education faculty, and one science education graduate student) rated the questions independently according to the four categories of the taxonomy.Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 17 for Windows. The ratings from the five raters had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88. Cronbach's alpha measures how well a set of items (or variables) measures a single unidimensional latent construct and varies from 0 to 1.0. Values above 0.7 or 0.8 are considered very good in the sense that they indicate that raters are attending to the same underlying construct. In this case, 0.88 suggests that the five raters had general agreement on the underlying four-category structure of the taxonomy when applying it to the exam questions. With respect to the intraclass correlations coefficients, there was a Single measure score of 0.60, p < 0.000 and an Average measure score of 0.88, p < 0.000. Intraclass correlation coefficients measure the degree of reliability of the ratings. They can range from 0.0–1.0. The single measures are the reliability if using just one of the judges. The average measure is the reliability using all the judges. Because our average measures were higher than our single measures, we decided to use the ratings of the 2002–2007 exam questions from all five raters rather than relying on the ratings of any one individual.To further understand the underlying conceptual structure represented by this taxonomy, we used SPSS to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis on the five individual rater classifications of each of the 149 photosynthesis and cellular respiration exam questions (\n\nFigure 2). Cluster analysis groups objects based on their similarity on one or more attributes (in this case exam question ratings from five raters.) The resulting taxonomic tree shows which objects are most and least similar. There are several methods of producing the clusters, but the most commonly used is the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA.) UPGMA begins with a standardized data matrix from which a resemblance matrix is computed that measures the distances between each pair of objects. The objects are then combined into clusters based on their similarities. The clusters are combined until there is a single cluster containing all of the objects (\n\nRomesburg, 1984). The results may be displayed using a dendrogram or tree diagram, as shown in \n\nFigure 2. The individual “leaves” at the bottom of the figure are individual questions. The “leaves” have been color-coded based on the average rating each question received. The horizontal lines are the scaled euclidean distances between individuals or groups. Groups are defined by “cutting the tree”—drawing a horizontal line that crosses the vertical lines, or “branches.” The branches define the groups. In \n\nFigure 2, any horizontal line greater than 11 on the y axis cuts two branches, or groups. The cluster of questions on the right side of the figure (questions with an average rating ≥3.0) and the remaining questions on the left side (questions with an average rating <3.0) are least similar, with an average distance of 25 between those groups. The maximum difference between any pair of questions in the cluster on the right side of the figure is 7, and the maximum distance between the questions on the left cluster is 11. The only horizontal line that will leave four clusters would be between 10 and 11 on the y axis. However, these four groups do not cluster questions with the most similar interrater agreement, except for the branch on the far right side. The interrater agreement is highest for questions in the 1–2 range (orange to light green) and 3–4 (blue to purple) range because the average linkage distances between questions in these clusters is small (5 and 7 respectively), indicating relatively large agreement between raters. The average linkage distance between questions in the 2–3 range (darker green and light blue) is 11, indicating less agreement across the five raters on questions in the 2–3 range. This figure shows the clearest delineation between those questions with an average rating between 1 and 3 and those with an average rating between 3 and 4 (average linkage 25). This analysis suggests a strong agreement among our five raters that there are two broad clusters or categories of questions based on the taxonomy. We performed our subsequent analyses of student performance on these questions according to the two clusters produced by the hierarchical cluster analysis, Category <3 and Category ≥3.Figure 2.Dendrogram of a hierarchical cluster analysis of 149 photosynthesis and cellular respiration exam questions from 2002 through 2005. Each question is represented by the “leaf” at the bottom of the figure that is color-coded to show the average rating of the question by the five raters. The inset figure indicates the scale for the average of the five reviewers' ratings of categories described in \n\nTable 1. The lower the linkage distance score, the greater the agreement among reviewers. Note bifurcation into two distinct branches with questions with average ratings ≥3.0 clustered on the right.Student Performance on Exam QuestionsTo compare performance of students across years, we divided all of the 2002–2007 students into an upper 27.5 percentile (overall GPA = 4.0–3.4070), a middle 45 percentile (3.4069–2.6377), and a lower 27.5 percentile (2.6376–0) group. We calculated the cut scores for each of the groups by taking the incoming GPA of each student between 2002 and 2007 and then using these GPAs to create three distinct groups of students. Using the cut scores from these three groups, we examined student performance on Category <3 questions compared with those rated Category ≥3. \n\nTable 2 shows the numbers of students in each GPA group for each semester. There were two main reasons for disaggregating students by GPA. First, there is an increasing awareness in science education of those students who leave the sciences either before or during their postsecondary education (\n\nTobias, 1990; \n\nSeymour and Hewitt, 1997). Our assumption in creating the three GPA groups was that our lower and middle groups of students were more likely to contain more of these particular students who are at-risk for leaving. Second, the middle group contained a majority of the future K–12 science teachers. Because our research group included many science teacher educators, they were especially interested in how this group was performing on the different types of exam questions. In addition to the GPA groupings, we also disaggregated student performance according to topic, examining photosynthesis questions separately from cellular respiration questions so as to be able to detect any differences in student performance between these two topics.Table 2.Number of students in each GPA group per semesterSemesterLower 27.5 percentile GPA (n)Middle 45 percentile GPA (n)Upper 27.5 percentile GPA (n)FS0211513479FS0381137106FS0486202121FS0573165109FS06101201116FS077213868Cellular Respiration. \n\nFigure 3A shows student performance on cellular respiration midterm exam questions (administered following the instruction on respiration) by category of question and GPA group across semesters. The semester\/years are shown on the x axes. The percentage of correct questions are shown on the y axes. Performance by students in the lower, middle, and upper GPA groups are shown in the three rows of symbols indicated by color and shape of the symbol marking the mean for that year and the 95% confidence intervals shown for each group. Performance on questions with average ratings Category <3 are shown in the left column; performance on questions with average ratings categorized ≥3 are in the right column. In 2002 and 2004, there were no cellular respiration questions categorized as ≥3, so there are no values shown for those semesters in the figure.Figure 3.Student performance on cellular respiration exam questions (top of A) and photosynthesis exam questions (bottom of B) by category of question and GPA group (2002–2007). The first column contains graphs of student performance on questions rated <3. The second column contains graphs of student performance on questions rated ≥3. Performance for each of the three GPA groups (lower 27.5 percentile, middle 45 percentile, and upper 27.5 percentile) are shown with the means and 95% confidence intervals. QN is the number of questions in a particular category in a particular year.For Category <3 cellular respiration questions, there is a trend of improvement in student performance in the upper, middle, and lower groupings between 2002 and 2007. In terms of our framework for understanding, with the exception of 2006 in which there is a statistically significant drop in student performance that we discuss below, Bio101 students are generally improving from year to year in their ability to describe\/reproduce the cellular respiration model, to manipulate the teaching model within the contextual boundaries in which it was originally presented during instruction, and also to answer cellular respiration questions not directly related to specific aspects of the teaching model. By 2007, the 95% CI bars are above the values for years 2002–2004 in all three GPA groups, showing that students were performing better than they had been in the 2002–2004 time frame (p < 0.05).It is more difficult, however, to make any claims about Category ≥3 questions. Given the 95% confidence intervals and the smaller numbers of questions in this classification category, there is no trend of improvement in students' ability to answer these types of questions. In terms of our framework for understanding, this suggests that Bio101 students show no discernable year-to-year improvement in their ability to manipulate and\/or apply the cellular respiration teaching model beyond the contextual boundaries in which it was originally presented during instruction.Photosynthesis. \n\nFigure 3B shows student performance on photosynthesis midterm exam questions by category of question and GPA group. The semester\/years are shown on the x axes. The percentage of correct questions are shown on the y axes. Performance by students in the lower, middle, and upper GPA groups are shown in the three rows of symbols indicated by color and shape of the symbol marking the mean for that year along with the 95% confidence intervals. Performance on questions with average ratings Category <3 are shown in the left column; performance on questions with average ratings categorized ≥3 are in the right column.Again, for Category <3 photosynthesis questions, there is also a trend of improvement in student performance in the upper, middle, and lower groupings between 2002 and 2007, though the improvement for the lower GPA grouping is not statistically significant. In contrast with the cellular respiration questions, however, there is no drop in student performance in 2006. On the contrary, 2006 student performance follows a general trend in which Bio101 students demonstrate continuous improvement on these types of questions. In terms of our framework for understanding, Bio101 students are generally improving from year to year in their ability to describe\/reproduce the photosynthesis model, to manipulate the teaching model within the contextual boundaries in which it was originally presented during instruction, and also to answer photosynthesis questions not directly related to specific aspects of the teaching model.As is the case with Category ≥3 cellular respiration questions, student performance on Category ≥3 photosynthesis questions appears to decline; however, this is not statistically significant. In terms of our framework for understanding, this suggests that Bio101 students show no discernable year-to-year improvement in their ability to manipulate and\/or apply the photosynthesis teaching model beyond the contextual boundaries in which it was originally presented during instruction.Summary of Exam Question TypesIn terms of assessing students for understanding in photosynthesis and cellular respiration, \n\nFigure 3 displays two discernible trends. First, the total number of photosynthesis and cellular respiration questions included on exams increased sharply in 2004 from approximately 30–50, and this increase was maintained between 2004 and 2007, except for 2006, when it was 30. Compared with 2002–2003, the Bio101 instructors were allotting larger portions of their 2004–2007 exams to questions regarding these two topics. We know this to be true because the number of total exam questions used each year between 2002 and 2007 remained relatively constant. Second, as a percentage of the total number of questions asked per year, the number of questions rated Category ≥3 increased substantially. Between 2002–2004, Category ≥3 questions constituted an average of 14% of the total photosynthesis and cellular respiration exam questions. Between 2005–2007, however, these same types of questions constituted nearly 30% of the topic-specific questions. Compared with 2002–2003, the Bio101 instructors were asking more questions on their in 2005–2007 exams in which the students were expected to manipulate and\/or apply the teaching models in unfamiliar contexts.Taken collectively, these two basic trends highlight 2004–2005 as a two-year period in the course in which the Bio101 instructors began a shift away from previous assessment practices. Not only did they start devoting a larger percentage of their total exam questions to the photosynthesis and cellular respiration teaching models, but they also started devoting more of the photosynthesis and cellular respiration exam questions to Category ≥3 type questions. In the language of our framework for understanding, starting in 2004–2005 Bio101 students were asked to describe, manipulate, and apply the teaching models more than Bio101 students in previous years.","DISCUSSION\nBecause the total number of Category ≥3 photosynthesis or cellular respiration exam questions never exceeded seven questions in a single year, we ran into difficulty performing statistically meaningful tests. Thus, in 2003, for example, the year in which students appeared to perform significantly better on Category ≥3 photosynthesis questions than in other years, there were only two questions available for use in the analysis.\nThe cluster analysis suggests that, while there is good rater agreement on the classifications of exam questions using the four-category system, there is little difference among Categories 1–3, which is the rationale for analyzing them in the two groups rather than all four. In addition, very few of the same questions were used in multiple years. This may account for differences in performance across years as different questions may have different levels of difficulty. Question difficulty (how students perform) is not necessarily a function of the taxonomic classification. There can be questions on which many students do well, or poorly, at any taxonomic scale. See \n\nAnderson et al. (2001, chapter 16) for a discussion of the empirical evidence for student performance as a function of Bloom's taxonomic classification of questions. Their meta-analyses show stronger correlations in student performance on Bloom's taxonomies are between knowledge (“lowest” level) and evaluation (“highest” level) than between adjacent levels, suggesting that student performance is not a function of the Bloom taxonomy of the questions.\nSeveral findings of importance are discussed below in greater detail. These include 1) confronting a long-standing pattern observed by the course instructors regarding class averages on exam questions, 2) confronting the 2006 “dip” in student performance on Category <3 cellular respiration—but not photosynthesis—questions, and 3) confronting the overall lack of steady gains in student performance on Category ≥3 questions for both photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\nThe 62% RuleCourse reform efforts in Bio101, particularly between 2002 and 2007, had been significant. Focused mostly on teaching and learning of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, key concepts for the course, they had included the introduction of handheld, electronic student response devices or “clickers,” the development and administration of conceptually linked “sequences” of clicker questions to address key course concepts, and the use of the DQCs (\n\nWilson et al., 2006) both in class and on exams. Despite the 6-yr-long commitment to course reform, the course instructors observed that class averages on both midterm and final exams between 2002 and 2007 rarely surpassed 62%. These averages were based on all questions, including both DQC and non-DQC questions. The “62% Rule,” as it came to be called, was cited by the instructors as evidence that the extensive course reforms had not had their anticipated (beneficial) effects on student understanding, at least as measured by student performance on exams.The results of our analysis of student performance on Category <3 and Category ≥3 photosynthesis and cellular respiration questions provide us with a different perspective on the 62% Rule. While the overall exam averages remained fairly constant between 2002 and 2007 (there were only 3 of 24 total exams in which the class average was higher than 62%), we found that students were in fact improving on Category <3 photosynthesis and cellular respiration questions and that their performance on Category ≥3 questions remained, for the most part, the same. For the class averages to remain steady at 62%, these gains in performance in Category <3 questions must have been consistently offset by students' performance on questions about other topics, such as cell cycle and DNA transcription and translation.2006 Dip in Student PerformanceOne potential explanation of the 2006 decrease in student performance on the Category <3 cellular respiration exam questions (\n\nFigure 3) involves both temporal and conceptual components. In almost every year included in our study, the Bio101 instructors tested their students on cellular respiration and photosynthesis on the same midterm exam (the second of three midterm exams). In 2006, however, the initial unit on large biomolecules was dispersed throughout the course. The result was that the instructors taught the cellular respiration unit earlier in the semester and included it on the first midterm exam but kept photosynthesis on the second exam. Thus students prepared for the exams on the photosynthesis and cellular respiration models separately. It is possible that this instructional change had conceptual consequences and that the performance decrease that year indicates the significant conceptual “dividends” of addressing these two topics close together in terms of instruction and assessment. This raises the question: How might certain ways of understanding photosynthesis have desirable effects or influences on particular ways of understanding cellular respiration?Student Performance on Category ≥3 QuestionsWhile, with the exception of 2006, student performance on Category <3 exam questions resulted in steady gains, student performance on Category ≥3 exam questions did not. There are many possible explanations for the students' inability to apply and\/or manipulate the models of photosynthesis and cellular respiration beyond the contextual boundaries in which they were originally presented during instruction. One is that while our implemented reforms led to changes in some components of the course, they may not have been as effective in promoting changes in other areas. For example, our framework for understanding and assessing the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration allows for a certain degree of precision and specificity not found in other existing frameworks for understanding biology. How the affordances of this framework are communicated to and implemented by instructors is a complex undertaking and thus is still a work in progress. A case in point is the Bio101 instructors' use of frameworks associated with the DQC project. The DQC frameworks for understanding organize the content associated with cellular respiration and photosynthesis around a set of specific practices—such as tracing matter, tracing energy, and keeping careful track of issues related to scale and context\/location. The goal of the DQC frameworks is to help students reduce the perceived complexity of topics like photosynthesis and cellular respiration in a systematic way such that they can then apply a similar framework to problems and topics beyond photosynthesis and cellular respiration. While the instructors engaged certain dimensions of the DQC frameworks by asking students questions and\/or emphasizing particular terms and concepts during the lectures, they did not explicitly present, construct, and\/or otherwise explore and unpack the DQC frameworks for understanding with their students. Given their goals for student understanding of these concepts, the explicit and consistent use of the frameworks would go a long way toward helping students better understand the specific knowledge and performances that are expected of them. Such use requires significant investment of time and commitment, and we are encouraged by the changes we have observed as our colleagues have begun to take on the task of instructional reform using these frameworks and assessment tools as both instructional and diagnostic resources.Our work has also led us to an interest in examining more closely the questions we are presently classifying as Category ≥3. It is possible that questions within this category vary in their demands on student understanding. For example, some Category ≥3 questions contain highly technical discipline-specific terminology, whereas others with the same rating consist of less technical, more commonly used terms. An example of a technical item is a question the Bio101 instructors regularly use about thylakoid membranes (“Assume a thylakoid is somehow punctured so that the interior of the thylakoid is no longer separated from the stroma. This damage will have the most direct effect on which of the following processes?”). The mean rating of this question was 3.4; 39% of the students answered it correctly. An example of a less technical item is a question the instructors commonly use about the growth of maple trees (“A mature maple tree can have a mass of 1 ton or more—dry biomass, after removing the water—yet it starts from a seed that weighs <1 g. Which of the following processes contributes the most to this huge increase in biomass?”) The mean rating of this question was 3.8; 48.5% of the students answered it correctly. It is possible that these two different types of questions place particular types of linguistic and\/or conceptual demands on students that we have yet to fully account for in our present framework for understanding.Implications and ConclusionsOne of the challenges we are addressing in our work is to find more explicit and productive ways to “tune” the visual representations commonly used during instruction of photosynthesis and cellular respiration to our evolving framework for understanding. One way this tuning has occurred is that the course instructors have created more opportunities for their students to practice describing, manipulating, and applying the models in class. For example, one of the two instructors created a pedagogical intervention with the aid of iClicker® technology. Using PowerPoint and the handheld student response system, he helped students construct an important teaching model for cellular respiration from scratch by using an interactive image-driven story of a marshmallow burning over a campfire. Another way this tuning has occurred is that we have begun to foreground those principles featured in our framework and in the teaching models themselves. For example, we are working with course instructors to fine-tune standard visual representations for photosynthesis and cellular respiration (i.e., their teaching models) and align them more carefully and explicitly with the practices articulated by the DQC framework (i.e., tracing matter, tracing energy, and identifying scale and location).Explicit instructional moves to share teaching models as well as relevant practices with students seems particularly important given what Lemke has called the “mystique of science” (\n\nLemke, 1990). Our experiences suggest that science instructors should develop prolonged, strategic, and explicit ways of sharing what counts as target understandings of important concepts with their students. Our initial investigations, in which we explicitly situate a problem within the framework and continually engage students in making use of these practices, suggest that this mystique is removed and increased understanding results.While we have made use of multiple-choice format questions as a vehicle for assessing students' ability to engage in principled use of teaching models, we also have used more open-ended question formats. (In fact, it was from student answers to such assessments that many of our foils for the multiple-choice items were identified.) Thus, there is no reason why these frameworks and tools could not be used with short-answer or essay questions and provide valuable feedback to instructors and students alike. In addition, our taxonomy can be adapted to any teaching model and therefore can be used by instructors to align assessment items with their teaching model and used for similar longitudinal studies.Finally, we are pleased that our focus on principled use of models has been taken up by those in other disciplines (e.g., geology, chemistry), both at our institution and at others around the country. We have made the resources we have developed available at http:\/\/dqc.crcstl.msu.edu. We anticipate that as we further develop and refine teaching models and assessments that reflect core concepts of a discipline, we also will be able to develop more effective pedagogical strategies to support students' ability to make principled use of these models to understand science more deeply and to see the interrelationships among the different science disciplines."],"title":"The Development of a Conceptual Framework and Tools to Assess Undergraduates' Principled Use of Models in Cellular Biology"},
{"pmid":"20810948","sections":["INTRODUCTION\nThe idea of creating a biomathematics program at Murray State University (MSU) began in 2003. A group of biology and mathematics faculty began meeting on a regular basis to explore common research and teaching interests. We were driven by a desire to work together to improve the quantitative skills of our biology majors and the modeling skills of our mathematics majors (National Research Council [NRC], 2003a,b). Interdisciplinary research experiences have been demonstrated to be of great benefit for undergraduates (Fortenberry, 1998; Lopatto, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008; Erbes, 2008). In 2004, we received a Research Incubation Grant from the Kentucky National Science Foundation Experimental Program for the Stimulation of Competitive Research (NSF EPSCoR) that allowed us to fund a regular biomathematics seminar and a statewide workshop. In 2005, we were awarded an NSF Interdisciplinary Training for Undergraduates in Biological and Mathematical Sciences (UBM) grant to fund an interdisciplinary undergraduate research program in mathematics and biology—BioMaPS (http:\/\/campus.murraystate.edu\/biomaps).\nThe BioMaPS program has enhanced the interdisciplinary environment between mathematics and biology colleagues and students. It also has created new relationships with disciplines such as chemistry, geosciences, animal health, computer science, and business that have served to further the impact that biomathematics have had at MSU and nationally. The students and faculty have provided many presentations and publications at local, regional, national, and international venues. The BioMaPS program has affected change in the collaborative research that has been investigated and the curriculum available for students interested in biomathematics opportunities. This manuscript outlines the BioMaPS program initiatives in regard to the seminars and workshops; UBM goals; UBM structure; and UBM achievements, curriculum opportunities, and discussion.","SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS\nWith funding from the Kentucky NSF EPSCoR, we initiated a biomathematics seminar in January 2004. Beginning in 2005, matching funds from the College of Science, Engineering and Technology allowed us to continue the seminar as part of our UBM award. The seminar has typically met eight times a year since its inception. Topics such as epidemiology, neuroscience, amphibian ecology, marine biology, genetics, immunocompetence, invasive species, and cancer models have been discussed. Mathematical techniques have ranged from continuous (differential equations, optimal control, and inverse problems) to discrete (combinatorics, graph theory, and game theory). Multivariate, spatial, and Bayesian statistics also have been applied to a variety of biological topics.\nAlthough many of the speakers have been visitors, we also incorporated local speakers to emphasize that much of the research carried out by MSU mathematics and biology faculty is interdisciplinary. We also encouraged students to give talks about their undergraduate research experiences at MSU and at Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs elsewhere. Of particular note was a seminar entitled “Mathematics and Biology Curriculum—What MSU Students Think!” given by our students. All BioMaPS seminars are open to the campus community.\nThe seed money from the Research Incubation grant also was used to fund the Biomathematics in the Commonwealth Workshop in 2005. Mathematicians and biologists from colleges and universities throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky were invited to this meeting to discuss the intersections of biology and mathematics, with a view to positioning Kentucky as a leader in curriculum reform in response to BIO2010 (NRC, 2003a). This was the first of a series of workshops that have been held as part of our program. Later workshops were designed with the needs of our UBM students in mind.","UBM GOALS\nThe BioMaPS program's main objective is to provide students with an intensive year-long interdisciplinary research experience involving teams of faculty and students with expertise in mathematical and biological sciences. We equip five to six students per year with the skills to understand patterns and to develop accurate models of biomedical and ecological phenomena. We developed a program that encompassed a calendar year cycle (January–December) that included bimonthly seminars, weekly meetings with faculty mentors, research proposal development, investigative research experience, and compilation of research into a final presentation and document. The program supports two or three teams annually, each consisting of two faculty mentors (one in each discipline) and at least two undergraduate students (one mathematics and one biology major). The program has had significant accomplishments, including presentations at conferences, participant awards for presentations at local and national events, invited plenary talks, minisymposium talks at national and international meetings, and peer-reviewed publications.\nOur project is motivated by the increasing need for professionals who can understand the mathematics behind biology and the biological implications of mathematical models (Steen 2005a,b). As stated by Steen, “Mathematics is a science of patterns, and biology overflows with patterns” (Steen 2005b). Within the research programs, our objectives are to equip students with the skills to understand such patterns and to develop accurate models of biomedical and ecological phenomena by using methods from statistics, optimization, and differential equations. The projects have included modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes relating to fecundity, parameter identification, developmental stability, biodiversity, anthropogenic disturbances, invasive species, and population fluctuations in salamander populations.","UBM STRUCTURE: HOW DOES BioMaPS WORK?\nOur project design has been sculpted by assessments conducted during our current BioMaPS project. Annual cohorts of student members creating two research teams consisting of at least one mathematics and one biology student engage in interdisciplinary research with BioMaPS faculty (at least one from each discipline). Students in the program are required to take our Principles of Biomathematics course (MAT\/BIO 460) and courses suggested by their mentors that are relevant to their research projects. They work on their research project throughout the calendar year, with more extensive time devoted during the summer. Although our program advances discovery in the intersection of mathematics and biology, it also promotes the integration of research and teaching in mathematics and biology.\nStudent participants are selected by the end of October. To continue our success in undergraduate research in biomathematics, we advertise, recruit in our classes, and evaluate potential undergraduate researchers from both the Departments of Biological Sciences and Mathematics and Statistics for research positions. To increase the size of the applicant pool, we ask other faculty members in both departments to nominate students who are both interested and qualified to be undergraduate researchers. We also have both faculty and current undergraduates who are involved in biomathematics research visit classes, from freshmen orientation to upper-level courses, to help recruit other promising young scholars. We target students during the beginning of their sophomore year for a 1- to 3-yr research experience. We pursue a variety of avenues to actively recruit from groups underrepresented in the sciences, including women, minorities, low-income, and first-generation college students through our McNair Scholars Program and Student Support Services. After we have built a pool of strong candidates, we personally contact and recruit these students. Students are chosen based on both their academic accomplishments (minimum grade point average of 3.0), assessed through a comprehensive application, letters of recommendation, statement of goals, and a personal interview.\nAn initial meeting between mentors and students to discuss their research plans takes place in November to determine whether a particular course(s) is needed to better prepare the students for the research. Course work is scheduled for the spring term.\nBeginning in January (Table 1), students meet with their faculty mentors at least weekly to learn the fundamentals of scientific research at the interface of mathematics and biology. The first meetings focus on developing and writing a research proposal, to be orally presented during a BioMaPS seminar. Research projects begin after faculty mentors have approved the proposals. Also during this time, students develop an action plan for their research goals and activities. As the spring semester comes to a close, students will orally present their preliminary research plans and any findings.\nTable 1.Timeline for student activitiesFall 1SpringSummerFall 2Application (Oct.)Weekly mentor meeting (start Jan.)Workshop (April\/May)Weekly mentor meetingSchedule classes (Nov.)Biomathematics courseFull-time research (May\/June)Monthly BioMaPS seminarsMonthly BioMaPS seminarsRevised research plan (Aug.)Research proposal (April)Symposium (Sept.)Outreach presentations (Oct.)Reapplication (Oct.)Interim\/final report (Dec.)All students and mentors attend scheduled BioMaPS meetings throughout the academic year. Within these meetings, the goal is collaboration among the groups. If a team has a biological or mathematical question, these meetings create opportunities for other teams to provide input and possible solutions. Issues related to careers in biomathematics, such as government, industrial and academic opportunities, internships, Graduate Record Examination preparation, gender and racial issues in science and mathematics, and choice of and preparation for graduate and professional schools are addressed.\nEach year, a cohort of BioMaPS students attend a workshop. A major goal of the workshop is to provide instruction in research methods above and beyond what students learned during introductory mathematics and biology courses. The workshops provide students with appropriate tools for all stages of their research and focus on data collection and analysis, presentation of results, and writing. Some topics included in the workshops are as follows: sampling, experimental design, use of software for statistical analysis (such as R), use of graphics for reporting scientific results, modeling rates of change with calculus and differential equations, basic laboratory techniques, and ecological theory. These workshops have included outside speakers. In 2008, we provided a nationally publicized biomathematics workshop free to all and encouraged undergraduates to present their research in a poster session. It also provided opportunities for our students to have interactive discussions with our plenary speakers: John Jungck (Beloit College), Andy Long (Northern Kentucky University), and Chris Mecklin (MSU). In 2007 and 2009, students attended conferences as their workshop to learn from international experts (Mathematical Association of America\/Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB) NUMBeRS Workshop and SMB international meeting).\nDuring summer, extensive time is spent on research projects. Each pair of students is expected to work full-time on their project and students are paid appropriately so that other employment will not be necessary. In September, a symposium is held for BioMaPS participants, where students along with their mentors present their findings. Potential future participants are invited to the symposium as well, at which time the framework of the program and the application procedure are explained. The symposium serves as a recruitment opportunity for the next cohort of students. During the fall semester, participants give presentations about their BioMaPS research within freshman orientation groups, residential colleges, and local high schools. The goal of these presentations is to give current and future undergraduates a better understanding of what biology and mathematics can accomplish when viewed as a cohesive unit rather than disjoint disciplines, as well as to train our current BioMaPS students in teaching and outreach.","UBM ACHIEVEMENTS\nUndergraduate BioMaPS fellows have given 30 presentations at local, national, and international conferences. In conjunction with students, the faculty has given an additional 29 presentations at professional conferences. The students serve as coauthors on seven peer-reviewed publications and BioMaPS faculty have generated a total of 33 peer-reviewed articles. The students and faculty have been successful in obtaining 12 research grants from local and national organizations during the past 4 yr.\nA defining aspect of the project is the collaboration of four female and three male investigators across two disciplines. These mentors have the ability to attract a diverse group of students based on their different but complementary backgrounds. The mentors have experience working with >140 undergraduates who have given >100 research presentations during the past 10 yr. Each student group has given oral and poster presentations at MSU Scholar's Week annually. The teams also submit poster presentations for the local Sigma Xi Poster Competition, with two teams being selected as the Best Undergraduate Presentations in different years. Four teams have provided presentations at the Kentucky Academy of Sciences annual meeting, with one team receiving the Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award in their discipline. Three student groups have given presentations at the Southeastern Ecology and Evolution conference, the American Society of Mammologists meeting, and Southeastern Atlantic Differential Equations meeting. The teams have presented posters about our UBM program and have given invited research talks at the SMB meetings and at the Undergraduate Research Conference at NIMBioS. UBM students have visited local high schools and engaged students in conversations related to their research presentations. Several of our students were selected to present at Kentucky's Posters-at-the-Capitol. At this event, students had the unique opportunity to discuss their research with politicians and to highlight the benefits of undergraduate research.\nWe have had several students extend their program because they were eager to continue their research. To date, we have worked with a total of 12 students (three males and nine females). Of the six students who graduated, three students are in Ph.D. programs in biology with mathematical modeling emphases, one student is in a computer science master's program, one student is an industrial database manager, and one student is entering law school. Of the six remaining students, four students are graduating in 2010. Of these four students, three students will enter graduate school in science fields and the other student will teach mathematics at the secondary level. The remaining two students will graduate in 2011.\nOur project has impacted non-BioMaPS students in courses taught by the UBM faculty because faculty integrated biomathematics applications in their courses from the freshmen through graduate level. In the past 4 yr, approximately 1000 students have had access to biomathematics concepts in this manner. Approximately 200 students (and numerous non-BioMaPS faculty) a year attended the BioMaPS seminars at which UBM students and external speakers gave research presentations. The seminars incited further interest in the BioMaPS program and provided opportunities to involve students not supported by UBM funds in biomathematics research. In two cases, graduate students worked in the laboratory with the UBM teams providing further integration outside of the program.","CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT\nStudents in the BioMaPS program are required to take our Principles of Biomathematics course (MAT\/BIO 460) and courses suggested by their mentors that are relevant to their research projects. With prerequisites in Calculus and Introductory Biology, the course is designed to prepare students for interdisciplinary work and provide them with a thorough understanding of scientific principles.\nThe course uses materials from An Invitation to Biomathematics (Robeva et al., 2008). Where possible, topics are chosen to best serve the students enrolled in the course. Approximately half of the course is taught in a traditional lecture format. The remainder consists of guest speakers, inquiry-based computer labs, wet labs, reading discussions, and student presentations.\nThe guest speakers allow integration of the course with the existing biomathematics seminar. The guest speakers provide students with an understanding of how mathematics and biology can be integrated to solve problems that are interesting, timely, and important to both disciplines. Students are required to submit papers that summarize the presentation, discuss the significant biological and mathematical issues raised by the speaker, and make connections to what they have learned in other classes in mathematics, biology, or both.\nThe computer labs allow students to explore simulations of predator–prey models, SIR models, Mendelian genetics, and Hardy–Weinberg equilibria and to perform data analysis such as t tests and analysis of variance. Wet labs have studied intraspecific competition for plants and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Students are expected to submit assignments based on the computer and wet labs. Papers for the reading discussions have included Jungck (1997), Munz et al. (2009), Wainer (2007) and Ives et al. (2008). Future plans for this course include testing bioalgebraic modules being developed by Terrell Hodge (Western Michigan University) and Raina Robeva (Sweet Briar College).\nA major portion of the Principles of Biomathematics course revolves around the term project. Students must choose a topic in mathematical biology for their project. During the first 2 yr that the course was offered, students were required to choose their topic from the ten equations paper by Jungck (1997). Some of the topics that students chose included the Michaelis–Menten equation, the Hodgkin–Huxley model, the Haldane function for genetic mapping, Luria–Delbruck models of fluctuation and mutation, and phylogenetic trees. In 2010, students were encouraged to choose their own topics, although suggestions were available. Topics chosen included chemotaxis (Murray, 1988) and the use of PageRank in ecosystems (Allesina and Pascual, 2009). A preliminary article including a brief mathematical description of the model and some discussion of the biological situation being modeled is submitted. Students also must present their term project at a special session of MSU's Scholars Week (Undergraduate Research and Scholarly Activities, 2010). For this presentation, students must write a scientific abstract for the Scholars Week program. Finally, students write a 10- to 12-page final paper providing the biological background and mathematical justification for the topic they studied. At a minimum, they must explain the notation and the equations in the model. Some students have derived the relevant equations. Others have provided numerical and graphical examples. Students must explain why and how the model is used. They are expected to identify the biological questions that the models have allowed scientists to answer. They also are asked to discuss what new mathematics, biology, or both (if any) have arisen from these equations.\nTo better serve our BioMaPS students and to affect change across the university, we have developed a mathematical biology emphasis within the context of the existing applied mathematics area. The mathematical biology emphasis is based on relevant biology and mathematics courses. We are in the process of incorporating a mathematical biology emphasis into the biology area. Our goal is to develop a Mathematical Biology minor consisting of current courses such as Calculus, Differential Equations, Biological Inquiry and Analysis, Botany, Zoology, Ecology, Biostatistics, and Principles of Biomathematics.\nDuring its last offering, our Mathematical Modeling course was restructured to incorporate biological topics. This course will continue to be offered every other year. As our next step, we will develop and offer special topics courses for juniors and seniors in Biostatistics and Mathematical Biology with a view to incorporating them as cross-listed courses into the regular curriculum.","COMPARISON\nOur program is unusual in that it provides an integrated research experience to our undergraduates. Unlike a summer research program, such as an REU, our students have time to delve into the literature during the spring semester and also to write papers based on their research in the fall. In several cases, students have continued to work on their research after they have completed their time as BioMaPS fellows but before they have graduated. REU participants benefit from the new perspective offered by working with students and faculty who are not at their home institution. The expertise of the faculty involved may be substantially different from that of the faculty at their home institution.\nThe long-term nature of the mentoring was of great benefit to both the students and the faculty. The integration of the Principles of Biomathematics class and seminar into the BioMaPS program in the spring semester provided training for the students as they developed their research proposal. The seminar speakers gave BioMaPS students exposure to different areas of expertise and a sense of the importance of their interdisciplinary studies. The continuation of the seminar in the fall provided students an opportunity to present their work. Students were invited to suggest speakers that were relevant to their projects and they did!\nHowever, the long-term structure was not without its challenges. Problems did not go away when the summer was over. Our pool of student applicants was sometimes very limited. In any institution, there are a finite number of talented biology and mathematics majors with sufficient interest in both disciplines to be willing to apply. Of those students, some may choose to pursue a more traditional summer experience elsewhere because of a desire to strengthen a graduate school application. Furthermore, in the current economy our students are under considerable financial pressure. Committing to research for the summer rather than to a job that would pay their next semester's tuition was simply not an option for some. In one unfortunate situation, a participant's economic interest outweighed their scientific interest, which led to problems with his\/her team members that were difficult to resolve.\nWe believe that the integration of the traditional summer research experience into the undergraduate curriculum in this program is very portable. The basic structure of long-term research combined with course work and a seminar is manageable at many different types of institutions, particularly those with a strong emphasis on undergraduate research.","CHALLENGES\nChanges in the BioMaPS program have evolved from experiences with curricular and communication issues. With curricular components, two challenges arose. Because the Principles of Biomathematics course was initially team taught by a mathematics and a biology professor, the professors desired to have this course count in their load. Yet, this did not occur. It was taught as an overload for one and was not counted for another. Basically, it was taught for the benefit of the students without compensation. Even though team teaching at a regional university is plausible, it can be difficult to put into practice. The succeeding iterations of this course involved one lead instructor (with the course counting in her load) with guest modules. The modules incorporated active-learning experiences with experimentation and statistical algorithms. These scenarios introduced the flavor of a team-taught course with expertise from three or four faculty members in biology or mathematics and provided the students with interactive learning experiences. A second curricular challenge surfaced from the development of a biomathematics area as well as the instigation of the Principles of Biomathematics course. The area is comparable to a major and minor combined into one concentration. The background work among the biology and mathematics faculty was relatively painless. One issue for the faculty was the appropriate course number for the Principles course and obtaining a cross-reference feature for it to count toward a mathematics or biology degree, but this was readily resolved. The time-consuming constraint was obtaining the necessary approval for the course and the biomathematics area through the proper administrative channels. Having contacts within those administrative channels is invaluable.\nContacts and communication go hand and hand. Whether a grant is received for a similar project or this framework is developed without external funds, the person in charge must have good interpersonal skills to be able to navigate the politics across two disciplines as well as within administrative positions. Learning how to communicate in understanding the expectations of the parties involved in the different disciplines is crucial to the success of each project. First, a retreat or workshop with faculty and students that encourages open communication is highly recommended. The BioMaPS program was involved in a Communications across the Disciplines workshop organized by faculty from Old Dominion University in theater and mathematical biology that centered on an interactive atmosphere with an underlying component of trust. It gave each participant an understanding of personality types and different communication styles. Such retreats could be developed with consultations with organizational communications departments, theater, and discipline-specific departments. Second, an important aspect of communication and trust involves successful liaisons built with administrative offices. For the BioMaPS program, these connections have been built through much patience with areas as accounting. On different occasions, the BioMaPS investigators felt that there was little control of such items as dispersal of necessary payments. Solid oral and written communication skills are critical to resolving these issues. Third, in a modest-sized, regional university such as MSU, the support staff has many responsibilities. Therefore, it is imperative to find a competent staff member to address the many paperwork issues that arise. The overarching theme of the changes within the BioMaPS program incorporates a greater understanding of the necessity of excellent communication skills.\nThe focus of the BioMaPS program has made inroads into increasing the number of educated undergraduates who can communicate effectively and professionally in their interdisciplinary studies of biology and mathematics. The goals of the BioMaPS program encourage these students to continue in these efforts. As mentioned in the UBM achievements section, the BioMaPS students have demonstrated their success through selection in graduate programs with mathematical biology emphases, with one receiving an NSF graduate research fellowship. Other students are using their skills in computer technological careers and as educators in the K–12 classroom.","DISCUSSION\n“Modern biology is integrative; the goal should be to erase the boundaries between disciplines” (Haushalter and Asai, 2006). This principle has guided our biomathematics program from its inception. Over the past 5 yr, with the help of the NSF UBM–funded BioMaPS project, we have increased the amount of interdisciplinary research between faculty and undergraduate students in biology, mathematics, and statistics. Our ongoing biomathematics seminar has increased both the awareness and interest of mathematical biology among our students. Labov et al. (2010) describe the lack of communication between biology and mathematics departments as one of the impediments to The New Biology. Our group considers communication to be one of its highest priorities. Through our course and program development and through our undergraduate research program, we have improved MSU's ability to integrate the education of its mathematics and biology students with the goal of providing a model for other cross-disciplinary integration across our campus."],"title":"BioMaPS: A Roadmap for Success"},
{"pmid":"20810965","sections":["INTRODUCTION\nRecently, scientists have directed much attention to revising undergraduate biology curricula in ways that better reflect the tools and practices of science (National Research Council [NRC], 2003; American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2009). Introductory biology courses traditionally focus on delivery of specific content, with little attention to promoting the practice of quantitative skills used by scientists within those content domains. Of the thousands of undergraduate students who crowd the large-enrollment introductory biology courses, a small fraction will pursue a career in the biological or medical sciences. These future biologists and physicians need to develop fluency in the quantitative tools and language used in interdisciplinary science (Gross, 2000; Association of American Medical Colleges [AACU] and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2009; NRC, 2009; Labov et al., 2010). They will probably need to apply sophisticated integrative and quantitative approaches to generate research questions, analyze and interpret evidence, develop models, and generate testable predictions (NRC, 2003, 2009). At the same time, all introductory biology students are citizens and members of society. Nonscientists and scientists alike are confronted daily with scientific and pseudoscientific claims based on quantitative measures regarding their health, environment, education, and more. All need the tools to interpret numeric information and to be able to apply them in making reasoned decisions (Tritelli, 2004).\nQuantitative literacy (QL), also known as numeracy, is a “habit of mind,” the skill of using simple mathematical thinking to make sense of numerical information (National Council on Education and the Disciplines, 2001). Although mathematics is often abstract, QL is contextualized and refers to the ability to interpret data and to reason with numbers within “real-world” situations (Steen, 2004). The AACU included QL among the few key outcomes that all students, regardless of field of study, should achieve during their college education (AACU, 2005). Institutions such as James Madison University and Michigan State University include quantitative reasoning as one of several general learning goals for all their students (complete lists are available at www.jmu.edu\/gened\/cluster3.shtml and http:\/\/undergrad.msu.edu\/outcomes.html, respectively). Through institution-wide assessment programs, these universities are measuring the scientific and quantitative reasoning skills of all students at the beginning and the end of their liberal learning curriculum (Barry et al., 2007; Ebert-May et al., 2009). Such initiatives promise to yield data that will inform the broader academic community of the level of QL among our undergraduates, as they enter and leave college.\nAlthough some colleges have established programs and courses devoted to teaching and learning quantitative reasoning, most universities do not have an explicit plan for helping students gain QL skills during their undergraduate studies. QL is not a discipline in and of itself; therefore, it is unclear who is responsible for teaching QL. In addition, standards for QL assessment are not yet clearly defined at the institutional or curricular level. Translating broad institutional learning goals into specific learning objectives in the context of individual courses is critical for identifying what kind of evidence demonstrates QL achievement (Ebert-May et al., 2010).\nMaking QL a Goal of Biology CoursesCurrently, most undergraduate biology students take several semesters of required courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry in addition to the high school mathematics courses needed for admission to college. This background, however, is not an accurate predictor of students' ability to reason quantitatively about biology (Bialek and Botstein, 2004; Hoy, 2004). Because QL is the ability to apply mathematics in a specific context or discipline, the biology curriculum is one natural “place” where students should practice applying quantitative thinking about biological problems. Accordingly, advocates for the reform of introductory biology suggest developing new interdisciplinary courses that integrate the traditionally quantitative disciplines with biology (Bialek and Botstein, 2004). Others argue that quantitative concepts should be incorporated into existing biology courses throughout the entire curriculum, including general introductory biology courses (NRC, 2003; Gross, 2004; Hodgson et al., 2005; Yuan, 2005). In either case, attending to the quantitative reasoning needs of undergraduates is an issue requiring commitment and coordination at the institutional as well as course level (Hoy, 2004).Motivated by the widespread consensus that QL is an important learning outcome for all students, we sought to embed quantitative thinking within an introductory-level biology course. In this article, we illustrate how a team of instructors infused quantitative concepts into the existing framework of a large-enrollment Introductory Biology course for science majors. Specifically, we describe the following:\nThe learner-centered instructional design we used to support the inclusion of QL concepts in our introductory biology course.Our approach to rapidly assess students' QL abilities.Evidence that students significantly improved in their ability to graphically represent quantitative data throughout the course.We focused our intervention on basic quantitative skills that biologists routinely apply in their practice, which include representing and interpreting data, and articulating data-based arguments. The construction and evaluation of scientific arguments is particularly well suited for applying quantitative reasoning (Lutsky, 2008). We adopted, for this purpose, a simplified view of arguments, derived from the classic model proposed by Toulmin (1958): an argument is the statement of a “claim” supported by “evidence,” where the reasoning or justification leading from evidence to claim is referred to as “warrant” (Toulmin et al., 1984; Booth et al., 2008; Osborne, 2010). Students in our course often worked on problems presenting biological data (evidence) and were asked to articulate conclusions (claims) based on such evidence, and to provide appropriate reasoning (warrants) in support of their claims.","METHODS\nCourse DescriptionWe conducted this study at a research university during one semester of a large-enrollment Introductory Biology course for science majors. The course is part of a two-semester introductory biology sequence and focuses on principles of genetics, evolution, and ecology. This course is currently the subject of a comprehensive reform aimed at implementing evidence-based, learner-centered instructional practices (Handelsman et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005; Handelsman et al., 2006). There are no mathematics pre- or corequisites for this course beyond the requirements for entrance to the university (3 yr of high school math, including 2 yr of algebra and 1 yr of geometry).Study Population and Research ContextApproximately 80% of the students enrolled in the course were in their first or second year of college (48 and 32%, respectively). Life science majors (e.g., zoology, plant biology, biochemistry) and prehealth or preveterinary students made up 60% of the course population (Table 1 and Supplemental Material). For this study, we analyzed and reported data from students in one course section who completed pre- and postinstruction assessment of QL skills (n = 175).Table 1.Students by majorMajor\/trackNo. of students (%)Life sciences63 (35)Science, other (e.g., chemistry, etc.)23 (13)Mathematics7 (4)Engineering9 (5)Prehealth track26 (14)Preveterinary track19 (11)Social sciences20 (11)Humanities9 (5)Undecided4 (2)This study was conducted in the context of a broader initiative aimed at reforming the introductory biology curriculum. The research was reviewed and classified as exempt by the university's Institutional Review Board.Instructional DesignInstructors responsible for three of the course sections (150–190 students per section) met weekly to collaborate in all aspects of course design. Weekly meetings focused on constructing common learning objectives and creating learning activities and assessments used in all three sections of the course. We designed all class meetings to engage students through active, inquiry-based pedagogy. At the beginning of the course, we discussed with students the broad course goals, which included learning about the nature of science and knowing how to build scientific knowledge. To achieve these goals, students actively engaged in the activities of scientists, such as collaborative problem solving, creating and interpreting conceptual models, and articulating and evaluating scientific arguments.Our strategy for infusing quantitative thinking in the normal course of instruction was through iterative assessment of students' QL skills, followed by feedback. We designed and administered (at the beginning of the course and then repeatedly throughout the semester) formative and summative assessments, which incorporated quantitative problems that complemented and supported learning of the biology concepts in the course. These assessments allowed us to rapidly determine whether students were fluent in QL skills directly relevant to biology. Based on the assessment outcomes, we tailored instruction in all three sections to provide students with feedback and further practice, if necessary.Throughout the semester, we articulated specific QL objectives (Table 2) that complemented the existing course content and learning objectives. Rather than developing stand-alone QL modules, we designed instructional modules, homework, and quiz and exam items that incorporated QL objectives. In the course, students encountered multiple opportunities (Table 3) to apply quantitative thinking in the context of problems about genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology. All classroom activities and assessments were followed by instructor feedback.Table 2.QL objectives incorporated into introductory biologyStudents should be able toPerform simple manipulations of numerical data and express data in graphical form1a.

Use appropriate reasoning (i.e., experimental design and\/or statistics) to support the validity of data-based claimsExemplars of QL-infused InstructionIn the first week of the course, we implemented a module—the “termite activity”—that addressed the nature of science and incorporated several quantitative aspects. In class, students observed termites following the trace of an ink pen on a sheet of paper. Working in collaborative groups, students observed a small number of termites and the termites' responses to different inks. Students quickly made the observation that termites prefer the ink traces from certain pens while ignoring others. We asked students how a scientist would start from this simple observation to generate evidence to build a scientific claim regarding the termites' behavior (e.g., “what would you need to do to demonstrate that termites prefer ink A to ink B?”). Students worked at developing testable hypotheses about the termites' ink preferences and designed simple experiments to collect quantifiable data about this behavior. To do so, students needed to devise a reproducible method for gathering quantitative data about the termites' ink preferences; conduct an experiment; and record, analyze, and interpret the data.Instruction throughout the semester followed in this manner. Although it is beyond the scope of this article to illustrate in detail each activity, we direct the reader to Ebert-May et al. (2010) and to an example of a teaching and learning module that we implemented in the course (a case study on evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; http:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/42411).After the termite activity, we assessed students' learning about the nature of science on the first in-class quiz, which included the Frog problem (Figure 1), designed to assess both students' understanding of the nature of science and QL skills. The Frog problem presented students with an experimental scenario and a data set. Students were asked to calculate means (objective [Obj.] 1a), represent the data graphically (Obj. 1b), draw conclusions based on the evidence (Obj. 4a), justify their claim (Obj. 4b), and deduce from the experimental setup what hypothesis that experiment was testing (Obj. 3).Figure 1.The Frog problem, adapted from an original problem (http:\/\/first2.plantbiology.msu.edu\/resources\/inquiry_activities\/frog_activity.htm). This problem was developed by D. L. and D.E.M., based on the work of Kiesecker (2002), and includes text quoted from Miller (2002).In the context of the unit on evolution, we taught about Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium by using a classroom simulation that required students to calculate allele and genotype frequencies (Obj. 1a) and to make predictions based on observed and calculated data (Obj. 3a). Within the ecology unit, students investigated the impact of invasive species on aquatic ecosystems by exploring the case of sea lampreys in the Great Lakes (www.glfc.org\/lampcon.php). Students generated a graph of population growth (Obj. 1b); developed a null hypothesis (Obj. 3a); interpreted a chi-squared value (Obj. 2a); and articulated a complete scientific argument, including a claim (Obj. 4a) and warrant (Obj. 4b).The final exam was structured around the case of the moose and wolves of Isle Royale, Michigan (www.isleroyalewolf.org\/wolfhome\/home.html). Students answered questions on genetics, evolution, and ecology within the context of the Isle Royale ecosystem, with particular emphasis on the moose and wolves. One item on the exam (Wolf problem; Figure 2) presented students with a data set and asked them to calculate frequency values (Obj. 1a), represent the frequency data in a graph (Obj. 1b), and predict what kind of warrant would be necessary to support a claim based on those data (Obj. 4b).Figure 2.The Wolf problem. The data that guided design of this problem are publicly available through the “Wolves and Moose of Isle Royale” website (www.isleroyalewolf.org\/overview\/overview\/wolf%20bones.html).Analysis of Students' QL SkillsFor this research, we focus on analysis of the Frog and Wolf problems. For both problems, we asked students to perform a simple calculation and to create a graph from the resulting data. We assigned a score of 1 or 0 (correct, or incorrect or missing) to each of the following elements, common to both graphs:\nGraphing the calculated data (means for the Frog problem; frequencies for the Wolf problem)Appropriately labeling the y-axisAppropriately labeling the x-axisUsing an appropriate type of graph for the data (a bar graph, in both cases)Each graph received a composite score, the sum of all four elements. For example, a score of 4 means a student graphed the calculated data using a bar graph and labeled both axes correctly. Scores of ≤3 indicate an error in one or more areas. We compared students' scores at the beginning (Frog problem) and at the end of the course (Wolf problem) by using a paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. Statistical analysis was conducted in the R statistical environment (R Development Core Team, 2009).We also developed simple rubrics for coding the claims and warrants students generated as part of these problems:\nThe Frog problem asked students to formulate a claim based on the given evidence and to provide appropriate reasoning (warrant) to support the claim. We assigned a score of 1 or 0 for presence\/absence of each of these following elements in the students' claims:Student stated that atrazine alone has no effect.Student stated that trematodes alone have an effect.Student stated that the combined effect of trematodes and atrazine is greater than that of trematodes alone.Each claim therefore received a score between 0 and 3; a score of 3 indicates a complete and correct claim. Students' warrants were analyzed for explicit reference to elements of experimental design. We scored students' warrants as correct based on whether they mentioned at least one of the following elements of the experimental setup:Large number of frog eggs usedNumber of replicates − three for each treatmentUse of the appropriate experimental controlsThe Wolf problem provided quantitative evidence and a claim, and asked students what kind of warrant would support that claim. Students' warrants were scored as correct if they explicitly stated that a statistical test of significance (such as the chi-squared test) should be performed on the data to support the claim.Based on patterns we observed in the students' warrants, we also identified elements that characterized incorrect reasoning. In this study, we focused on two kinds of “incorrect reasoning”: a) the student restated the claim and (b) the student restated the evidence, by either pointing at the raw data or at the graph. We scored students' warrants for presence (or absence) of these elements.","RESULTS\nWhat QL Skills Do Introductory Biology Students Bring to the Course?Analysis of student responses on the Frog problem revealed that, at the beginning of the course, students had difficulties with representing data on a graph, properly labeling the graph axes, and formulating complete and correct arguments (Figure 3).Figure 3.QL skills demonstrated by students at the beginning of the course (assessed through the Frog problem).Graphing Data. Only 57% of students correctly calculated and represented the data as means on a graph; 33% of students plotted the individual data points, rather than the means, and ∼9% plotted the sum of the data. An appropriate label for the y-axis, in this problem, included the dependent variable (frogs with deformities) and the units (percentage). Only 10% correctly labeled the y-axis on the graph; most students were inaccurate in their labeling, and the majority (∼67%) only labeled the y-axis with the word “percent” or the % symbol.Articulating Data-based Claims. A complete and correct claim on the Frog problem included three statements, one for each of the experimental treatments (see rubric). Twenty-nine percent of students formulated a claim that included the results of all three treatments. Approximately two-thirds of the students, however, wrote a claim that was incomplete. Most students neglected to include in their claim that exposure to atrazine alone had no effect (no frog deformities observed). Reference to this particular piece of evidence was missing in ∼55% of all students' answers (Table 4).Table 3.Number of classroom activities and of homework, quiz, and exam items addressing the QL objectives listed in Table 2QL objectivesClassroom activitiesHomework itemsQuiz and exam itemsTotal1a835161b452112a01012b21135393a51063b20134a4104184b48719Do Students' Graphing Skills Improve in the Course?Analysis of the Wolf problem provided evidence of students' progress in their ability to graphically represent numerical data. We applied the rubric described in Methods to assign a score between 0 and 4 to each student graph, where 4 was a complete and correct graph. Statistical comparison of individual students' scores at the beginning and at the end of the semester indicated that, after instruction, students were significantly better at representing data graphically (Figure 4A). For example, a very high proportion of students labeled their graphs appropriately: 92% correctly labeled the y-axis and 95% correctly labeled the x-axis (Figure 4, B and C). This reflects students' learning the need to frame graphs so that readers can understand them, e.g., by labeling them in ways that describe the data (Booth et al., 2008).Figure 4.Pre- and postinstruction change in the quality of student-generated graphs; “pre” refers to the Frog problem on quiz 1, and “post” refers to the Wolf problem on the final exam. (A) Scores attributed to students' graphs significantly improved after instruction. (B) Examples of student graphs that earned a score of 4 on the Frog problem (top) and the Wolf problem (bottom). (C) Change in the percentage of students who demonstrated specific graphing skills.The only category in which students had overall a lower score on the Wolf problem was that of creating an appropriate kind of graph. However, on the Frog problem, we explicitly asked students to create a bar graph; 99% created a bar graph, demonstrating that they knew how to do that. On the Wolf problem, we gave no instructions on what type of graph to use and 87% of students appropriately chose a bar graph to represent their data (Figure 4C). Students in the other two course sections that received the same instruction performed in a very similar manner on the Frog and Wolf problem. Data about the majors' distribution and graphing skills assessed across the three course sections are available as Supplemental Material.How Do Students Reason to Support Data-driven Claims?Early in the semester, we discussed and practiced how scientists design experiments to test hypotheses by including appropriate controls, changing one variable at a time, performing replicates, and using large sample sizes. The Frog problem immediately followed instruction on the nature of science and experimental design; therefore, we looked for explicit reference to elements of experimental design in students' warrants (e.g., “I can make the claim above […] because I designed an experiment that had all the appropriate controls, I repeated each trial three times, I used a large number of frog eggs each time”). Analysis of the warrants (Table 5) revealed that 27% of students provided appropriate reasoning to support their claim, by citing one or more elements of the experimental design. Specifically, 15% cited the large number of frog eggs used, 23% cited the number of replicates for each treatment, and 4% cited the use of appropriate controls in the set-up of the experiment.Table 4.Analysis of students' claims on the Frog problemScoreaNo. of students%Claim componentsAtrazine onlyTrematodes onlyAtrazine plus trematodes35129✓✓✓25620✓✓9✓✓3✓✓15323✓5✓3✓0159a A score of 3 indicates that a claim was complete and correct.

Later in the semester, students practiced applying simple statistical tests, both in the classroom and in the laboratory. On the Wolf problem, we provided the claim that frequencies of wolves with malformed vertebrae were “statistically significantly different” among the three populations sampled. Only 30% of students, however, appropriately reasoned that a statistical test of significance was necessary to justify this specific claim.Although the Frog and Wolf problems required different kinds of reasoning, we identified some fallacies in students' warrants that were common to both problems (Table 5). Many students, rather than providing some kind of reasoning, simply restated the claim. Far more students restated the evidence, either by pointing at the raw data or at the graph (e.g., “as evident from the data” or “as the graph clearly shows”).","DISCUSSION\nEarly in an Introductory Biology course, and then repeatedly throughout the semester, we assessed students' QL abilities and determined that students had deficiencies in key QL skills. The assessment evidence guided us to develop instruction tailored to the students' needs and abilities. We did not change the course structure, content, or learning objectives; rather, we embedded in our instruction QL elements that aligned with the existing course learning goals. What we view as the primary vehicle for infusing QL into our course is a learner-centered instructional approach. This means instructors were flexible and open to modify instruction based on student feedback from assessments (e.g., Just-in-Time Teaching [JiTT]; see this page for reference to Novak's papers on JiTT at http:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/introgeo\/justintime\/references.html).\nFurthermore, this approach required creativity, to craft quantitative problems and data-based classroom activities for students to work on in the context of biology. Finally, implementing this kind of instruction required frequent assessments, of multiple kinds (Smith and Tanner, 2010). We achieved quick turnaround times by using clearly defined rubrics to score students' work; in some cases, homework and in-class work that served the purpose of practice were only scored qualitatively. By the end of the term, our students made significant gains in their QL abilities. Below, we discuss some of the challenges we encountered in teaching and learning QL in introductory biology.\nLearning QL in Introductory BiologyStudents came to our Introductory Biology course with a wide variety of mathematical abilities and backgrounds, acquired in their high school (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000), and sometimes college mathematics courses. We could not assume that they were prepared to use quantitative reasoning in the context of biology. The evidence we gathered confirms that students needed additional practice to become fluent with basic quantitative tools and language. Weaving QL through the fabric of the undergraduate Introductory Biology course provided students with the opportunity to practice applying quantitative skills while learning biology.In our course, students improved in some quantitative skills, such as performing simple calculations and representing quantitative data in graphical form (Figure 4). However, other QL areas, such as the construction of data-based scientific arguments, proved more difficult. Creating a scientific argument from claim to warrant is a high-level cognitive task and is atypical of introductory biology courses, which tend to focus on factual recall and conceptual comprehension as the primary modes of learning (Momsen et al., 2010).With respect to the task of constructing scientific arguments, formulating appropriate warrants proved especially challenging for students (Table 5). Although the nature of evidence and claims is relatively straightforward (e.g., “what data do you have?” and “what conclusion can you make based on these data?”), the nature of warrants is more ill-defined. By definition, a warrant is the reasoning connecting evidence to claim (Toulmin et al., 1984; Booth et al., 2008). Naturally, the kind of reasoning required to justify a claim largely varies depending on the context of the argument and is often specific of a community of practice (Toulmin et al., 1984). Students' warrants (Table 5) indicate a pervasive conception that “numbers speak for themselves” failing to show the line of reasoning that justifies appropriating the data as the basis for the claim. This observation should not be surprising. The ability to explain how a given set of numbers can lead to a claim, that is, learning to argue like a biologist, is a highly sophisticated skill that requires practice and feedback over time. Student-centered inquiry-based learning environments are well suited to support the development of this skill through frequent formative assessments that provide students practice and feedback across multiple contexts.Teaching QL in Introductory BiologyWe identified three major challenges that introductory biology instructors may perceive as obstacles to incorporating QL in their courses.1. My Course Is Already Packed with Content. How Am I Going to Fit in QL?Our approach was to begin with clearly defined course objectives and incorporate additional QL objectives (Table 2) that contribute toward understanding of key biology concepts. We did not make room to “teach math” but created opportunities for students to use the quantitative skills they already have in the context of biological problems. Frequent assessment coupled with feedback proved an effective strategy to support student learning. We found that QL infusion does not distract from content, rather greatly supports teaching and learning about difficult topics, such as the nature of science and the construction of scientific knowledge.2. How Do I Choose What Quantitative Concepts to Include in My Course?The list of all quantitative concepts that are relevant to biology (NRC, 2003) is long and may discourage a well-intentioned instructor from even considering incorporating quantitative concepts in their Introductory Biology course. However, the table of contents in biology textbooks is long as well, and every instructor needs to choose course content and objectives. These course content and objectives can guide instructors to select the QL skills and concepts that are most appropriate for understanding specific biology concepts. For example, our evolution unit includes teaching and learning about the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium theory. One of our objectives is that students are able to apply the Hardy–Weinberg theory to determine whether a population is evolving, based on change in allele frequencies over time. To test this theory in a case study, students must 1) calculate and understand the meaning of frequencies; 2) know how to plug numerical values in a formula and perform simple calculations; 3) distinguish between expected and observed results; and 4) know when a statistical test of significance is necessary to reject a “no-change” or null hypothesis model.3. How Do I Know That My Students Are Developing QL Skills?Formulating appropriate measurable learning objectives (such as those in Table 2), and assessing their achievement, is in our experience the most straightforward way of answering this question. Resources such as the Quirk project website (http:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/quirk\/About_QuIRK.html) offer a valuable “blueprint” of generic QL objectives that can be tailored to any specific instructional context. Frequent assessments, aligned with the objectives, will inform instructors of the students' progress. Immediate formative feedback will inform students of their own learning and address difficulties. Clearly, the kind of assessment that promotes achievement of QL goals requires students to think independently and to show their work. If we truly want our assessments to reveal what learners are thinking, we need to move away from multiple-choice tests where guessing often occurs, toward “alternative” ways of testing where students have to demonstrate their abilities and make their thinking explicit (Smith and Tanner, 2010).","CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\nInformal feedback from students in our course confirmed that introductory biology students, as reported previously (Spall et al., 2003), do not see biology as a quantitative science. However, there is rapidly growing consensus among the scientific community that quantitative abilities are critical for future biologists and for independently thinking citizens. Our study indicates that incorporating QL in a large-enrollment introductory biology course through an active-learning pedagogy is immediately feasible, consistent with the broader undergraduate introductory biology learning goals, and enables students to develop important quantitative skills, without requiring additional resources or formal course restructuring. However, the approach we describe represents a small-scale intervention, targeting a single course within a much broader curriculum. Ideally, we should infuse QL across the entire curriculum (Gross, 2004), to ensure that students acquire a broad range of quantitative tools, gain extensive practice with them, and develop the belief that quantitative thinking is an intrinsic component in the construction of scientific knowledge. To advance in this direction, the biology education community may greatly benefit from a national dialog aimed at developing a consensus on what specific QL skills biology students need, and how to build them in the college curriculum. This is not a challenge unique to biology education. The geoscience education community, for example, has recently initiated a similar discussion on how to teach college geoscience in ways that develop students' quantitative abilities (Manduca et al., 2008). The convergence of different scientific disciplines on a common overarching theme (QL) holds a tremendous potential for a broader dialog aimed at improving undergraduate science education.","Supplementary Material\n\n            \n               [Supplemental Material]"],"title":"1, 2, 3, 4: Infusing Quantitative Literacy into Introductory Biology"},
{"pmid":"23420415","sections":["Introduction\nInsect sensilla consist of an exocuticular outer structure by or through which stimuli are conveyed to one or more sensory cell processes within the sensilla. Shape and size of the cuticular outer structures vary, but most sensilla appear as hairs or pegs. In such sensilla, the socket region can be distinguished from the shaft of the hair or peg (Altner and Prillinger 1980). When sensilla have been examined on the insect body, antennal and mouthpart sensilla have attracted the most attention.\nIn insects, the antennae represent the primarily sensory structures and are usually richly endowed with sensilla. Most of these are generally distributed on the flagellum and exhibit a variety of forms and characteristics in relation to their various functions of contact chemoreception, mechanoreception and thermohygroreception (Chapman 1998). With regards Fulgoromorpha, most studies on antennal sensilla have focused on putative olfactory sensilla, located on the pedicel (reviewed in Bourgoin and Deiss 1994; Stroiński et al. 2011). Indeed, planthopper flagellum sensilla are less in number than in many other insect, and it is of interest that typical chemoreceptors seem to be absent. This absence is probably compensated for by the olfactory sensilla of the pedicel. In this respect, the low number of sensilla on the flagellum should be regarded as a possible functional specialization of the flagellum itself (Romani et al. 2009).\nIn Hemiptera, the mouthparts have evolved into a rostrum consisting of a short, conical and dorsal labrum and a longer segmented labium, bisected by a stylet groove within which lie the outer mandibular and inner maxillary stylets. The labial tip is bilobed with each right and left lobe exhibiting symmetrically distributed sensilla grouped into sensory fields (Foster et al. 1983b; Backus 1985). There are no chemoreceptors on the stylets that enter the tissue of the host. The only sensilla associated with the food canal are those of the cibarium (Foster et al. 1983a) and precibarium (Backus and McLean 1982, 1983, 1985). Consequently, the insects do not taste the food they are about to feed on until they begin to ingest it. In fact, the majority of the chemoreceptors found on the labium in Hemiptera are in a position enabling them only to monitor chemicals from the external surface of the host (Miles 1958; Backus 1988; Chapman 1995). For these primarily phytophagous insects, these labial sensilla provide the only direct link with the host-plant (Cobben 1988), and it is supposed that the receptors found in the labial tip provide the insects with information that influences their subsequent feeding behavior (Foster et al. 1983b). Labial sensilla might therefore selectively reflect evolution of these host-plant patterns and relationships (Attié et al. 2008) and simultaneously reflect the phylogenetical evolution of the group; accordingly, their study should bring some taxonomic\/phylogenetic signal that has not yet been tested with respect to these issues.\nThe labial sensilla of most hemipterans can apparently perform both chemosensory and mechanosensory functions, while dabbing with the labium, during plant surface exploration. According to Backus (1988), Heteroptera and Auchenorrhyncha are rather similar in their labial sensory system while these two groups show a greater diversity and variability than in Sternorrhyncha while Cobben (1988) indicated more diversity than expected, in Fulgoromorpha. In the latter group, the structure, function and classification of labial sensilla have been precisely studied in only two delphacid crop pests, Nilaparvata lugens by Foster et al. (1983a, b) and Peregrinus maidis by Backus (1985), and found to be similar. A very brief description of the labial sensillae was also published for another delphacid, Tagosodes orizicolus (Mora et al. 2001). In addition, a special subapical sensory organ was first reported by Sogawa (1977) and formally recognized by Cobben (1988) in various species in delphacids, dictyopharids and tettigometrids but probably absent in fulgorids. The purpose of this study is to investigate these and new characters referred to here as the labial sensory apparatus with the objectives of (1) completing a systematic description of the sensory structures and provide a terminology for future work and (2) to evaluate the usefulness of these characters for identifying taxa and for phylogenet studies in Fulgoromorpha.","Materials and methods\nThe study was based on dry material from the collections of the Museum National d’Historie Naturelle in Paris (MNHN). SEM photographs were taken from various species representing 15 families of Fulgoromorpha. The list of examined species is provided in Table 3. In the species marked with an asterisk (*), only the sub-apical sensilla were analyzed.\nThe specimens were coated in gold–palladium and photographed with a Jeol JSM 840 A.\nThe tips of the chemoreceptor dendrites can be covered by a viscous fluid (containing mucopolisacharides), which sometimes exudes through the terminal pore or wall pores of the sensillum (Chapman 1998). This was observed in the SEM photographs as artefacts visible on or around the peg gustatory, olfactory or contact-chemoreceptive sensilla.\nTerminologySensilla of insects occur in two classes as mechanosensitive or chemosensitive sensilla. Their terminology varies according to their function and morphology including ultrastructure, systems and features that do not overlap. The external morphology is based on the criteria established by Altner and Prillinger (1980), Zacharuk (1980) and Foster et al. (1983b). The different types of sensilla are given with their abbreviations (manly from Brożek and Chłond 2010) in Tables 1 and 2.Table 1Terminology and definition of sensilla used in the present paperCategoryFunctionPoreSensilla typeContact-chemoreceptive sensilla (bimodal sensilla)Gustatory and tactileUP: uniporous with one (sub-) apical poreSensilla basiconica: bristle- (BRSN1, BRSN2) or cone-like sensilla (BSN1, BNS2) with a flexible basal socket; 3–10 internal sensory neurons (Chapman 2003)Chemoreceptive sensillaGustatoryUP: uniporous with one terminal porePeg-like (PGSU1, PGSU2, PPSU) or clavate-like sensilla (CLSU), in an inflexible socket;3–10 internal sensory neurons (Chapman 2003)Chemoreceptive sensillaOlfactive and\/or thermicMP: multiporousVariously shaped sensilla (OPSM, CUSM, DSSM), peg-like (PGSM, PGSMC), tubular (ECLT), branched or multilobed (TEBM), placoid (PFPL).

They are distributed in various sensory fields and in different locations. Their topography allows us to recognize the following two main groups.Apical sensilla on the tip of the labiumIn most cases, these sensilla are located in sensory fields (SF) that are clearly differentiated from the rest of the labium tip, forming isolated convex or concave areas. The following two types are recognized: a dorsal sensory field (SFD) situated on each side of the apex of the labial groove and one medial or two paired ventral sensory fields (SFV). Sensilla are usually more numerous on the dorsal rather than ventral fields. Thirteen different morphological types of sensilla have been found on the labial tip (BSN1, BNS2, BRSN1, BRSN2, PGSM, PGSMC, OPSM, CUSM, DSSM, PPSU, PGSU1, PGSU2, CLSU).Sub-apical sensilla on the labiumOn each side near the tip of the labium, one or more sensilla are present. These correspond to the ‘preapical sensory organ’ described by Cobben (1988). They are situated into a more or less deep cavity. Three morphologically distinct sensilla types have been recognized (Sa-ECLT, Sa-TEBM, Sa-PFPL). They are multiporous sensilla, usually surrounded by numerous sensilla chaetica (CH1, CH2, CH3).Morphological characters of the sensilla of the apical segment of the labiumMechanoreceptive NP sensilla or contact-chemoreceptive UP sensilla: tactile and gustatory sensilla at the tip of the labiumThese sensilla are distinctly inserted within sockets and their bases are flexible. They are wider basally and gradually tapper to apex with the tip slightly rounded. The cuticular walls are smooth with a molting pore near the base (Fig. 1a–d). No terminal pore is visible, and therefore, these sensilla should be considered as mechanoreceptive sensilla. However, their characteristics and location suggest they may be contact-chemoreceptive sensilla with an indistinct terminal pore. While sensilla basiconica (BSN1, BSN2) are present in most fulgoromorpha families examined, bristle-like sensilla (BRSN1, BRSN2) are found only in Fulgoridae. These non-porous(?) sensilla are long, tapered toward apex, end in a fine-spun tip and have a molting pore at their base. The cuticular wall shows evident grooves. Sensilla basiconica and bristle-like sensilla are respectively subdivided into two groups according to their size as follows:Fig. 1Types and size of the apical sensilla of Fulgoromorpha. a, b BSN1 sensillum basiconicum. c, d BSN2 sensilla basiconica. e BRSN1 bristle-like sensilla. f BRSN2 bristle-like sensillum. g OPSM oval plate sensillaLarge (10–20 μm) sensilla basiconica, nonporous (BSN1, Fig. 1a, b).

According to Altner and Prillinger (1980), these are wall-pore sensilla or multiporous sensilla as described by Zacharuk (1980). Five types of sensilla showing morphological characteristics connected with olfaction or olfacto-thermo reception are as follows:Oval plate sensilla, multiporous (OPSM, Fig. 1g). A pair of this type of sensillum were found only in Nogodinidae below the dorsal sensory field (Fig. 16d, e, sensillum no. 12).Peg sensilla, multiporous (PGSM, Fig. 2a). Cone-shaped with round tip sensillum with length ranging between 2.0 and 4.5 μm according to family. One pair of this type of sensillum was observed in Ricaniidae (Fig. 11f–h, sensillum no. 8, L = 3.2 μm), Flatidae (Fig. 13c, h, L = 2.5 μm), Tropiduchidae (Fig. 14d, sensillum no. 1), Nogodinidae (Fig. 16e, sensillum no. 8?—probably), Dictyopharidae (Fig. 17e, f, sensillum no. 10, L = 2.1 μm) and Fulgoridae (Fig. 18d, sensillum no. 8, L = 4.5 μm).Peg sensilla, multiporous, complex (PGSMC, Fig. 2b). This sensillum is divided into two parts by a furrow. Its length is 10.8 μm (Fig. 12h), and its tip is strongly pointed (Fig. 12f, h). Only one pair of this type of sensillum was observed, in Issidae (Fig. 12c, sensillum no. 8).Cupola-shaped sensilla, multiporous (CUSM, Fig. 2c). In this sensillum, the upper part is strongly enlarged relative to its base. The length of this sensillum is 1.5 μm (Fig. 8h). One pair of this kind of sensillum appeared to be specific for Meenoplidae (Fig. 8c, e–h, sensillum no. 8).Dome-shaped sensilla, multiporous (DSSM, Fig. 2d). Short sensilla (above 0.82 μm) with tip strongly flattened distinctly multiporius. One pair of this type of sensillum was situated on the dorsal sensory field among peg sensilla in Delphacidae (Fig. 5c, e, f, sensillum no. 8), Cixiidae (Fig. 6c, d, sensillum no. 8), Achilidae (Fig. 7e, f, sensillum no. 8) and Kinnaridae (Fig. 9d, f, h, sensillum no. 8).Chemoreceptive UP sensilla: gustatory sensilla at the tip of the labiumThese gustatory sensilla are bristles, hairs, pegs or just elevations of the cuticle, or a single flat cuticular area, all with a single terminal pore (TP-sensilla, uniporous) (Altner and Prillinger 1980). Peg sensilla have their side walls usually smooth but some have longitudinal ridges. They are divided into four types based on their length and shape of the tip as follows.Pit peg sensilla, uniporous (PPSU, Fig. 2e = sensilla coeloconica)These are typical peg-in-pit sensilla; they do not have any articulation and are characterized externally by a round aperture. The peg is oriented toward the inside of the pit in such a way that it is positioned in an exactly perpendicular position with respect to the external opening of the pit. One pair of these sensilla was observed in representatives of Delphacidae (Fig. 5e, f, sensillum no. 11), Cixiidae (Fig. 6d, sensillum no. 11), Achilidae (Fig. 7e, f, h, sensillum no. 10, L = 1.5 μm), Kinnaridae (Fig. 9d, f, h, sensillum no. 11) and Derbidae (Fig. 10b, e, f, sensillum no. 11).Peg sensilla, uniporous (PGSU1, Fig. 2f)These cone-shaped sensilla are long (5.0–7.5 μm) with a rounded tip.

Only observed in Issidae.Mechanoreceptive NP sensilla: tactile sensilla of the labiumSensilla chaetica (CH) are the most abundant types of sensilla found on the labium in Fulgoromorpha (Fig. 3a). On the apical segment, they occur in different lengths and are articulated by a connective membrane to the cuticule (Fig. 3b). They exhibit grooved surfaces without pore (Fig. 3a, c). Based on their length, shape and surface morphology, three types are differentiated as follows:Large (45–>100 μm) sensilla chaetica (CH1)—The sensilla are long, relatively straight, gradually tapering and slightly curved at the tip (Fig. 3d, e).Medium length (20–45 μm) sensilla chaetica (CH2)—Shorter than CH1, with a fine tip and a strong base and running parallel to the surface (Fig. 3a, d).Short (1–10 μm) sensilla chaetica (CH3)—Short with sharp ends (Fig. 3d).Olfactory and thermoreceptive MP sensilla: subapical labial sensillaOn each side and near the tip of the labium, there is one (or more) pair of sensilla that are multiporous, suggesting an olfactory and thermo-reception function. According to their shape, three main types are recognized as follows:an elevated, cone-like to tubular sensilla (Sa-ECLT) of 15.5 μm length (Fig. 4a–c).a branched or multilobated tubular sensilla of 8.0 um length (Sa-TEBM) (Fig. 4d).a placoid flattened sensilla (Sa-PFPL), peg-like, slightly convex or concave, surrounded by a double furrow (Fig. 4e–i). In Flatidae, the surface of the placoid (Sa-PMPL) has numerous minute 1 μm lobes (Figs. 4j, 13a, b).","Discussion\nThis paper presents the first comparative analysis of the labial sensilla in planthoppers. Although the studied examples of each family are small, some new and interesting general features are shown.\nThe planthopper labial sensory ground planThe sensory equipment in planthoppers consists of well-known mechanoreceptor sensilla chaetica plus specialized areas\/structures: the paired subapical sensory labial organs and the apical sensory labial area. With respect to the latter, the total number of sensilla at the tip of the labium allows us to recognize two main groups in Fulgoroidea. The first group exhibits 12–19 sensilla pairs (12 in meenoplids, derbids and achilids, 13 in cixiids, delphacids, dictyopharids and kinnarids, 14 in tettigometrids, 15 in tropiduchids and issids, 16 in nogodinids and 19 in ricaniids), and the second group shows a greater number of pairs (32 in flatids and 35 in lophopids and fulgorids). See Table 2.According to the currently accepted phylogenies of Fulgoroidea (reviewed in Bourgoin et al. 1997; Urban and Cryan 2007), it seems that the first group of families (noted above) is usually placed at the base of the phylogeny and therefore might represent the plesiomorphic condition. With the exception of the 6 sensilla basiconica (BSN1) observed in the ricaniid representative (that probably represent a specialized condition), the planthopper ground plan should therefore be represented by two pairs of sensory fields:dorsal paired sensory fields with 11 pairs of sensilla (10 peg-like pairs + 1 specialized pair dome or cupola-like)ventral impair or paired sensory field with 2 pairs of sensilla basiconica.The second group of families (noted above) is therefore to be regarded as advanced. The Fulgoridae have retained the 10 dorsal peg-like pairs (as in dictyopharids) completed by a great number of bristle-like sensilla (10 dorsal and 15 ventral pairs). Two families have increased their number of sensilla basiconica, that is, Lophopidae, with only sensilla basiconica distributed in 35 pairs, a pattern approached by the flatids with 17 peg-like and 17 sensilla basiconica pairs.It is probable that the eleventh specialized pair of dorsal sensilla (either clavate, dome-like or cupola-like) should be regarded as evolved from a more plesiomorphous peg-like sensillum.This planthopper ground plan can be compared to what is already known in other Hemiptera groups. In Sterrnorhyncha, the labial tip in Aleyrodoidea has seven pairs of sensilla (chemosensitive and contact chemoreceptive) according to a scheme apparently similar among species and sexes (Walker and Gordh 1989); in Psylloidea, four pair peg-like sensilla have been reported, but their exact function remains unknown (Garzo et al. 2012), and in Aphidoidea, only mechanoreceptive sensilla (eight or seven pairs) are present (Wesler 1977; Tjallingii 1978).In other Auchenorrhyncha, a trend toward a reduction of sensilla seems to have taken place (Leopold et al. 2003; Backus 1988), but a significant variation in type and distribution of sensilla has also been observed (Brożek in prep.).In Heteroptera, the labial sensilla have been studied in more than 70 species (Beck et al. 1958; Schoonhoven and Henstra 1972; Peregrine 1972; Cobben 1978; Avé et al. 1978; Gaffal 1981; Backus 1988; Rani and Madhavendra 1995; Ventura et al. 2000; Ventura and Panizzi 2005; Brożek 2008; Brożek and Chłond 2010).In most of these species, the sensilla are more or less numerous and of different shape and size, allowing us to recognize both chemosensitive sensilla (gustatory, contact-chemoreceptive) and mechanoreceptive sensilla. In Reduviidae, it has been shown that interspecific variability and intraspecific similarity in the shape and numbers of labial sensilla have potential usefulness as taxonomic\/diagnostic characters (Català 1996; Brożek and Chłond 2010).The above results confirm a ground plan of seven pairs of sensilla in Sternorrhycnha to a richer and more diverse sensory equipment in Auchenorrhycnha, particularly in planthoppers and Heteroptera as noted by Backus (1988).The labial sensilla in planthoppersAs noted above, this study reveals for the first time the diversity of sensory structures on the labial tip and their grouping into sensory fields in Fulgoromorpha. More taxa need to be studied before trying to present some general scheme at the family level, but some specific morphological types and their distribution seem characteristics of certain groups.Disparity of the apical labial sensilla: From the ground plan proposed for planthoppers (10 peg-like dorsal pairs + 1 dome or cupola-like dorsal pair + 2 sensilla basiconica ventral pairs), the great disparity reported in Table 2 suggests that it is the result of several independent evolutionary events from one plesiomorphic sensilla type, probably peg-like. Only more data\/taxa analyzed in a precise phylogenetical framework will allow us to understand how theses types have evolved.Distribution of the apical labial sensilla: At this stage, and according to their distribution, three patterns can be suggested.The general cixiid pattern (Cixiidae, Delphacidae, Achilidae, Meenoplidae, Kinnaridae, Dictyopharidae, Derbidae and Tettigometridae)Apical sensilla are clearly arranged in two sensory fields (Table 3). The number of the sensilla ranges from 12 to 13 pairs. According to the samples, only minor differences are observed and concern the type and number of sensilla. Among the more specific types of sensilla, the dome-shaped multiporous sensilla are absent in Meenoplidae and probably replaced by its homologous cupola-shaped sensilla. The peg-in-pit uniporous sensillum present in Delphacidae, Cixiidae, Achilidae and Kinnaridae has not been seen in Meenoplidae. In Dictyopharidae and Tettigometridae, the uniporous peg sensilla (PGSU2) are replaced by longer sensilla (PGSU1). Sensilla basiconica (BSN1, BSN2) are found in the above families only in the ventral sensory field.Table 3Distribution of the different apical sensilla in selected fulgoromorphan familiesFamilies and speciesTypes of the sensilla and their distributionScheme of the apical tip of labiumDelphacidaePeregrinus maidis (Ashmead, 1890)See Fig. 5a–fDorsal sensory field (SF-D) convex: 8 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 1 PGSU1, uniporous peg sensilla, long 1 PPSU, uniporous peg-in-pit sensilla 1 DSSM, multiporous dome-shaped sensillaVentral sensory field (SF-V)—unpair, convex: 2 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortCixiidaeMyndus taffiniBonfils, 1983Fig. 6a–dBrixidia boukokensisSynave, 1958Fig. 6e–fDorsal sensory field (SF-D) concave: 9 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 1 DSSM, multiporous dome-shaped sensilla 1 PPSU, uniporous peg-in-pit sensillaVentral sensory field (SF-V) concave: 2 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortAchilidaeBallomarius kawandanusFennah 1950Fig. 7c–fDorsal sensory field (SF-D) convex: 6 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 2 PGSU1, uniporous peg sensilla, long 1 DSSM, multiporous dome-shaped sensilla 1 PPSU, uniporous peg-in-pit sensillaVentral sensory field (SF-V) convex: 1 BSN1, sensilla basiconica, long 1 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortMeenoplidae*Kermesia immaculata Muir, 1927,Fig. 8a Nisia nervosa (Motchulsky, 1863)Fig. 8b–hDorsal sensory field (SF-D) convex: 9 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 1 CUSM, multiporous cupola-shaped sensillaVentral sensory field (SF-V) unpair, convex: 2 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortKinnaridae*Southia capnorhina Fennah, 1980, Fig. 9a*Atopocixius major Fennah, 1945, Fig. 9b Nesomircixia insularisSynave, 1958Fig. 9c–hDorsal sensory field (SF-D) convex: 9 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 1 DSSM, multiporous dome-shaped sensilla 1 PPSU, peg-in-pit uniporous sensillumVentral sensory field (SF-V) convex: 1 BSN1, sensilla basiconica, long 1 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortDerbidaeProutista fritillaris(Boheman,1838)Fig. 10b–gDorsal sensory field (SF-D) is divided into flat fields A and B: 4 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short (SF-D-A) 6 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short (SF-D-B) 1 PPSU, peg-in-pit uniporous sensillumVentral sensory field (SF-V) unpair, flat: 1 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortRicaniidaePochazia fuscataFabricius, 1803Fig. 11a–hDorsal sensory field (SF-D) concave: 6 PGSU2, uniporous peg sensilla, short 3 PGSU1, uniporous peg sensilla, long 1 PGSM, multiporous peg sensilla 6 BSN1, sensilla basiconica, longVentral sensory field (SF-V) concave: 1 BSN1, sensilla basiconica, long 2 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortIssidaeTrienopa paradoxa(Gerstaecker, 1892)Fig. 12b–cDorsal sensory field (SF-D) convex: 1 PGSMC, complex, multiporous peg sensilla, 8 CLSU), uniporous clavate sensilla 4 BSN2, sensilla basiconica, shortVentral sensory field (SF-V) convex: 2 BSN1, sensilla basiconica, longFlatidaeFlatia sp.(Schmidt, 1912)Fig. 13c–hApical sensilla are scattered widely on the labial tip.

Twelve pairs of sensilla are observable. The dorsal sensory field is subdivided into two fields (marked as A and B, Fig. 10b). The lower one (B) is located laterally in relation to the maxillae and mandibles. A characteristic feature is the presence of the uniporous peg-in-pit sensillum (PPSU) in the lower dorsal field. Sensilla basiconica (BSN2) occur only in the ventral sensory field. This specialized derbid pattern has very probably evolved from the general cixiid one.The general issid pattern (Issidae, Nogodinidae, Tropiduchidae, Ricaniidae and Lophopidae?)Apical sensilla are distinctly grouped into two sensory fields. A number of the sensilla range from 15 to 23 pairs. Sensilla basiconica (BSN1, BSN2) are present in the dorsal and ventral sensory fields. In the Tropiduchidae, Nogodinidae and Ricaniidae representatives, a multiporous peg sensillum (PGSM) is observed, probably homologous with the issid multiporous complex peg sensillum (PGSMC). In addition, in the Issidae species, a specific shaped uniporous peg sensilla (clavate with enlarged tip) is found.A unique arrangement of two sensilla located between the dorsal sensory field and the opening of the maxillae and mandibles is observed in the Nogodinidae (OPSM). A similar position of the BSN1 is found in Lophopidae which is also unique in its uniporous peg sensilla in the ventral sensory field and the great number of sensilla basiconica in the ventral sensory field. This represents a specialized pattern (lophopid pattern) that has probably evolved from the issid one.The specialized flatid and fulgorid patterns (Flatidae, Fulgoridae)In these families, apical sensilla are arranged in two sensory fields, but the boundaries between the fields are difficult to trace due to the numerous sensilla (32–35 pairs) that cover the entire labial tip surface, especially sensilla basiconica and bristle-like sensilla. Further studies are necessary to evaluate these patterns that have probably evolved independently.Sensilla chaeticaRecognition of 3 types of sensilla chaetica according to the length is an unexpected result. The medium type (CH2) seems the more largely distributed within the samples and might represent the plesiomorphic type from which evolutionary specialization has occurred toward shorter (CH3) or longer sensilla (CH1). In other parts of the insect body, mechanosensitive sensilla are of wide occurrence, so it is possible that the subdivisions proposed here may need to be revised when these are studied further.In the studied sample, the distribution of the three types of sensilla on the labial tip differs greatly as follows. Only type CH3 was present in Meenoplidae (Fig. 8b) and only type CH2 occured in Achilidae (Fig. 7a), Kinnaridae (Fig. 9c), Tropiduchidae (Fig. 14b) and Tettigometridae (Fig. 19a), while both these types were present in Delphacidae (Fig. 5a) and Cixiidae (Fig. 6a). Types CH1 and CH2 were noticed in Ricaniidae (Fig. 11b), Issidae (Fig. 12a), Lophopidae (Fig. 15a), Nogodinidae (Fig. 16c), Dictyopharidae (Fig. 17a, c) and Fulgoridae (Fig. 3a, d, Fig.18a, b). All three types were observed in Derbidae (Fig. 10a) and Flatidae (Fig. 13a).The subapical labial sensory organSogawa (1977) was the first to report the presence of a paired subapical sensory organ (wrongly named ‘labial palpi’) along the sides of the labium in some delphacids, represented by a pair of multiporous branched sensilla sunken into a small pit. This subapical sensory organ has since been found in most Fulgoromorpha families by Cobben (1988), Liang (2005) and in this study and also found in the 1st larval stage in Cixiidae (Thierry Bourgoin, unpublished data).All types observed are multiporous sensilla. The elevated, cone-like or tubular sensilla types were found in Cixiidae (Figs. 4a, 6a, b, e), Meenoplidae (Figs. 8a, b, 4b), Kinnaridae (Fig. 9a, b), Lophopidae (Figs. 4c, 15a) or Tettigometridae (Fig. 19d). The tubular branched shape (Fig. 5b) could represent an autapomorphic character for Delphacinae (Cobben, 1988). The last placoid flattened type was observed in Achilidae (Figs. 4e, 7a, b), Dictyopharidae (Figs. 4f, 17a, b), Tropiduchidae (Figs. 4g, 14a, b), Ricaniidae (Figs. 4h, 11b) and Nogodinidae (Fig. 4i, 16a, b). In Flatidae, the surface of the placoid was not flattened but multilobated with numerous minute lobes (Figs. 4j, 13a, b). Intriguingly, in several representatives, the sensilla were present in more than one pair, for example, 5 of them (placoid type) were found in Nogodinidae (Fig. 16a, b). In Tettigometridae (E. phyllostoma), 2 pairs of sensilla were observed, the anterior one being cone-like (Sa-ECLT) and the posterior represent rounded placoid convex sensilla (Sa-PRCS) (Fig. 19d).In other Hemiptera, the subapical labial sensory organ seems to be absent in the Cicadomorpha (Cobben 1988), but a very similar cixiid-like structure, called the “baton-shaped structure”, has been reported on the lateral subapical part of the labium of the bed-bug (Cimex hemipterus) by Singh et al. (1996, Fig. 3e). In the first conservative and parsimonious approach to these observations, we consider that the paired subapical organs are homologous in all planthoppers taxa. This same organ is rather polymorphic and can evolve into quite different shapes or might disappear. Again, according to the currently accepted phylogeny of the group (reviewed in Bourgoin et al. 1997; Urban and Cryan 2007), the organ comprising cone-shaped or tubular sensilla would therefore represent the plesiomorphic state (as in Cimex hemiptera), from which at least two new apomorphic-shaped sensilla have evolved: the multi-branched Delphacinae one and the placoid one, each obviously arising independently in several planthopper lineages. The apparent absence of these sensory structures in Derbidae and Fulgoridae needs to be confirmed. The presence of the organ cannot be considered as a possible synapomorphy for the clade [Cixiidae + Delphacidae + Achilixiidae + Achilidae] as stated by Liang (2005) but rather a symplesiomorphy for all Fulgoromorpha, if not a synapomorphy for all the Neohemiptera clade (Fulgoromorpha + Heteropterodea) (Sorensen et al. 1995). However, more morphological studies of the Hemiptera labium in all these groups are needed before positive conclusions can be reached. As suggested already by Cobben (1988), it is possible that, at least for the trunk-feeding fulgorids, the absence of the subapical sensory organs (if confirmed) could be linked to host-plant preference.Labial sensilla and their function in planthoppersThe labium and the olfactory functionIt is generally accepted that odorant substances, including sex pheromones and host-plant volatiles, diffuse through the wall pores of the multiporous sensilla into the sensillar lymph and are transferred to receptors on the dendrites of specialized neurons by special binding proteins (Leal 2005). In most insects, these olfactory multiporous sensilla occur mainly on the antennae and often on the palps, when these are present. In planthoppers, the characteristic sensory plate organs of the pedicel antenna (Bourgoin and Deiss 1994, reviewed in Stroiński et al. 2011), are very probably in charge of the olfactory function.In the current study, five multiporous sensilla without flexible sockets have been detected on the labium: the dome-shaped sensilla, the cupola-shaped sensilla, the oval plate sensilla, the peg and the complex peg sensilla. Similar sensilla are known in other hemipteran taxa such as Aleyrodidae (Walker and Gordh 1989) or Heteroptera (Schoonhoven and Henstra 1972; Peregrine 1972; Gaffal 1981), but sometimes also reported as absent (Avé et al. 1978; Hatfield and Frazier 1980; Rani and Madhavendra 1995; Brożek and Chłond 2010). As such types of sensilla are reputed to have an olfactory function (Slifer 1970; Zacharuk 1980; Steinbrecht 1984; Hallberg et al. 2003; Kristoffersen et al. 2006; Onagbola and Fadamiro 2008), one can say that the Hemiptera labium assists the antenna in this function, but the association has not yet been fully studied.The labium and the gustatory functionIn planthoppers, the dominant group of the sensilla at the tip of the labium is uniporous sensilla: peg sensilla (PGSU1, PGSU2) and, less commonly, peg-in-pit (PPSU) and clavate sensilla (CLSU). The different shapes of the uniporous sensilla on the labium are probably linked to the detection of both physical and various chemical stimuli that are non-volatile or have low volatility, and also through close or direct host contact. All sensilla are located in the dorsal sensory field and belong to the group of gustatory sensilla.After reviewing Chapman (1982), Backus (1988) pointed out that in heteropteran bugs, information about the volatiles emanating from the surface of plants, and their interaction with the insect cuticle, occurs during the exploration of the plant surface through antennation with the antennal flagellum. It suggests that this occurs through the contact-chemoreceptive sensilla with a gustatory function. In contrast, planthoppers do not antennate the plant during surface exploration, their antennae being too small to reach the plant surface. Accordingly, it is likely that the function of plant surface exploration is transferred to the apex of the labium in these insects, during dabbing the plant surface (Backus 1988; Ventura and Panizzi 2005). This evolution belongs to a form of exaptation (an additional new function for a plesiomorphic structure). How this evolution took place remains to be studied but obviously will need to be studied conjointly with the characteristic sensory plate organs of planthopper antennae.The labium and the contact functionUltrastructural studies show that sometimes a mechanoreceptive dendrite may be associated with sensilla that function as contact-chemoreceptive sensilla (Zacharuk 1980; Foster et al. 1983b). Such sensilla, with terminal pore and flexible socket, were not observed during our study, while Foster et al. (1983b) and Backus (1985) mentioned that some of sensilla should be regarded as mechano-chemoreceptive. However, there are difficulties in identifying the two types of sensilla which relies on the presence or absence of the terminal pore. Currently, it is uncertain whether the sensilla basiconica and bristle-like sensilla (BSN1, BSN2, BRSN1, BRSN2) have a terminal pore, although all are embedded in a flexible socket.Morphological evidence on the labial tip of other hemipterans suggested that contact-chemoreceptive sensilla occur rather frequently in Heteroptera (Schoonhoven and Henstra 1972; Avé et al. 1978; Hatfield and Frazier 1980; Gaffal 1981; Rani and Madhavendra 1995; Rani 2009; Baker et al. 2008) and Aleyrodidae (Walker and Gordh 1989) and Psyllidae (Garzo et al. 2012). Conversely, sensilla basiconica (BSN1, BSN2) that are the second most abundant type of sensillum found on the tip of the labium in Fulgoromorpha are typical mechanoreceptive sensilla. They are generally located in the ventral sensory field below the maxillar and mandibular stylets. They probably assist in positioning the labium during feeding.The subapical labial sensory organ and its functionIn the delphacids N. lugens and P. maidis, Foster et al. (1983b) and Backus (1985) reported the presence of many pores on the sensilla of the subapical labial organ, but with a slightly different structure and distribution of dendrites in comparison with the multiporous sensillum on the tip of labium. Their function has not yet been identified.In several different insects, it has been suggested that sensilla that are recessed from the antennal surface and located within cavities can be involved in measuring humidity and temperature (Steinbrecht 1984; Stange and Stowe 1999; Onagbola and Fadamiro 2008) and may play a role in preventing desiccation (Kristoffersen et al. 2006). Moreover, similar morphological structures (multilobed or branched sensilla) have also been suggested as possible hydro-receptive or olfacto-receptors (K3 type sensillum) in Coleoptera antennae (Roth and Willis 1951; Meinecke 1975). Accordingly, we provisionally regard them as complex dual functioning sensory organs. However, the placoid type observed in several taxa might operate only for more specialized olfactory functions, as on the antennal flagellum of cicadas (Klein et al. 1988).","Conclusions\nThe diverse type, number and distribution of labial sensilla appear much more important than previously supposed. This new set of characters, studied here, allows for the following conclusions:According to the morphological characteristics of the labium sensilla, it appears that they can provide planthoppers with information about tactile, olfactive and gustative stimuli when near or in contact with the plant. The gustatory function appears to be more recently evolved in Auchenorrhyncha compared to other Hemiptera that explore their host-plants by tapping with their antennae. Obviously, these findings will have to be put in perspective with the feeding behavior and diversity of trophic patterns in planthoppers and their host-plant as already observed (Attié et al. 2008).Clearly, this new set of characters brings some interesting evolutionary signal to further studies in taxonomy (identification) and phylogeny of the Fulgoromorpha. While conclusions at this stage are obviously premature, one can already see several issues for further studies:From a phylogenetical perspective, will the special types of sensilla observed be representative and autapomorphic of the groups in which they have been found? Is the presence of sensilla basiconica (BSN1, BSN2) in the dorsal sensory field a characteristic only of the higher fulgoroidea families? With more samples studied, will the two main patterns observed be broken into more specialized subdivisions and therefore what phylogenetical value will these smaller divisions have? At a higher level and with a bigger dataset what will be the implications of the presence\/absence of the subapical labial sensory organ have for the hemiptera phylogeny?From a behavioral perspective: what is the functional signification of the separate pair of sensilla between the dorsal and the ventral sensory field of the tip of the labium as observed in the nogodinid and lophopid representatives and of the three sensory fields in derbids? Will they have any value in constructing the phylogeny of these groups? Several representatives show a trend to the multiplication of the sensory units at the tip of the labium, is there any link between this morphology and diet? Can the absence of the subapical sensilla in Fulgoridae really be linked to a different mode of feeding (tree feeding) in these insects?"],"title":"Morphology and distribution of the external labial sensilla in Fulgoromorpha (Insecta: Hemiptera)"},
{"pmid":"23956490","sections":["Introduction\nThe skeletal muscles putatively involved in lymph movement in anurans are the M. piriformis, the complex of M. gracilis minor and M. abdominal crenator, M. cutaneus dorsi, M. cutaneus pectoris, and M. sphincter ani cloacalis (Drewes et al. 2007). The basis for their involvement in the movement of lymph derives from (1) their insertion on or attachment to the skin dermis (except M. piriformis and M. sphincter ani cloacalis), (2) synchronized EMG activity between these muscles with both lung expiration and pressure differences recorded in subcutaneus lymph sacs sufficient to move lymph (Drewes et al. 2007; Hedrick et al. 2007), (3) compromised rates of lymphatic return to the circulation when the tendons of these muscles are cut (Hillman et al. 2010), and correlation of their presence and size with measured rates of lymph return to the circulation (Hillman et al. 2011). The notion that these skeletal muscles have a combined primary function in lymph movement is unique and not suggested in any previous description of their function. While this functional role may seem arcane to some investigators, lymphatic return is in fact physiologically vital for anurans.\nThe role of the lymphatic system in all vertebrates is to return fluid lost from the capillaries to the circulatory system. Loss of blood volume (hypovolemia) leads to decline in cardiac output (hypovolemic shock) and death of the organism. The rate of capillary fluid loss (lymph formation) in anurans occurs at a rate up to ten times that of other vertebrates (Hillman et al. 2010). Anurans have extensive subcutaneus lymphatic sacs, and variation of these sacs has been described by Carter (1979). A schematic organization of the lymph sacs discussed in the manuscript is presented in Fig. 1. The morphological basis for the high rate of plasma turnover in anurans is the presence of these extensive subcutaneus lymph sacs, which create a large interstitial compliance (Hillman et al. 2010). The high interstitial compliance favors pooling of lymph in gravitationally dependent regions of the body (Hillman et al. 2004), the escape of plasma from the capillaries (Hancock et al. 2000; Hillman et al. 2010), and leads to high rates of plasma turnover—up to ten times that of mammals and birds per unit of tissue (Hillman et al. 2010). The pooling of lymph in dependent body regions is especially problematic for anurans. The lymphatic hearts which generate the pressure necessary to move the lymph back into the venous circulation are located on the dorsal surface of the animal (Kampmeier 1969). Hence, movement of the lymph dorsally from the ventral lymph sacs to the lymph hearts requires a physical driving force sufficient to overcome that of gravity. We have hypothesized that contraction of these skeletal muscles in conjunction with lung expiration generates the pressure difference required to move the lymph dorsally (Hillman et al. 2004). The goals of the current study were to evaluate the range of morphological variation present in each muscle and to preliminarily assess both the phylogenetic pattern and large-scale natural history association of this variation.Fig. 1Stylized illustrations of location and orientation of typical anuran subcutaneus lymph sacs. Note that the subvertebral lymph sac is depicted, but it is not subcutaneus and thus not influenced by the lymphatic pump muscles discussed here","Muscles involved in the compliance pump model\nIn most anurans, there are six muscles that contract synchronously with lung expiration; in our proposed compliance pump model, these serve to generate the pressure necessary for lymphatic return to the circulatory system via the lymphatic hearts. The presence or absence of these muscles among the anuran families is depicted in Fig. 2. The muscle terminology is generally from Gaupp (1896), except for M. abdominal crenator (Winokur and Hillyard 1992).Fig. 2The presence of skeletal muscles involved in lymphatic movement among the families of the anurans: M. gracilis minor—red, X = State 4 (see text); M. abdominal crenator—green; M. piriformis—blue, X = absent or reduced); M. sphincter ani cloacalis—yellow; M. cutaneus dorsi—brown; M. cutaneus pectoris—orange. Cladogram adapted from Frost et al. (2006, Fig. 66)\nM. ischiocutaneusNoble (1922) described this muscle and thought it represented a detached outer portion of the M. sphincter ani cloacalis. This muscle is present in only two genera of two families, the Rhinophrynidae and Scaphiopodidae. While no physiologic data exist to support a definite role in lymph movement, its origin (similar to the SAC) and cutaneus insertion (similar to M. cutaneus dorsi) suggest such a role. The M. ischiocutaneus is not included in this analysis.M. piriformis (Fig. 3a)Our reinterpretation of the M. piriformis (Drewes et al. 2007) includes the assumption that its origin is on the femur and insertion is on the urostyle, so that when the M. piriformis contracts, the urostyle is depressed, directly changing the volume and pressure of the pubic lymph sac. This interpretation is supported by our finding that contraction of the M. piriformis muscles in R. marina and L. catesbeianus measured by electromyography (EMG) also causes movement of the urostyle when the animals are not moving (Drewes et al. 2007). This interpretation differs from every other description of the M. piriformis which assume its origin as the urostyle and insertion as the femur, inferring some function in leg elevation (Prikřyl et al. 2009) or by providing pelvic rigidity during locomotion (Emerson and De Jongh 1980; Reilly and Jorgensen 2010). In the majority of neobatrachian frog groups, the urostyle has a monocondylar or bicondylar joint with the sacrum (Trueb 1973), presumably allowing for ventral–dorsal movement. The union of the muscle with the urostyle is at the latter’s distal end, far removed from its articulation with the sacrum. Given the typical mono- or bicondylar joint, the long lever arm, and the mass differences between the hind limb and urostyle, it is difficult to support the hypothesis that the urostyle is the origin for the M. piriformis. We maintain that contraction of the M. piriformis depresses the urostyle (Drewes et al. 2007) and that the latter moves in a ventral–dorsal manner analogous to a pump handle. It is possible that the M. piriformis is also active during other functions such as locomotion, but a primary role as a locomotor muscle for elevating the femur is not supported in light of our EMG data (Drewes et al. 2007).Fig. 3a Dorsal aspect of the insertions of the two symmetrical elements of the M. piriformis (P), dorsal view with dorsal skin reflected posteriorly to this insertion the M. sphincter ani cloacalis inserts on the cloacal tube (M. compressor cloacalis), (C) Lithobates catesbeianus—CAS 210381; b view of the posterior with M. sphincter ani cloacalis (S) in Rhinella marina (fresh, uncataloged). Origin (o) on fascia of the posterior rim of the pelvis below; this is also the origin of M. abdominal crenator (Fig 6b, c); insertion on dorsal surface of cloacal tube visible on a above; c dorsal view of insertion (i) of M. cutaneus dorsi (C) in Tomopterna marmorata (state 2—CAS 130883). Dorsal skin reflected posterolaterally to show insertion (i) along dorsal margin of the lateral lymph sacM. sphincter ani cloacalis (Fig. 3b)This muscle was first described by Ecker (1864). The origin varies from the posterior-most apex of the pelvic rim to ventrally on the pubic symphysis (Drewes et al. 2007). The paired slips pass dorsally and tightly adhere to the dermis of the pubic sac; they meet and insert on the fibers of the M. compressor cloacalis on the dorsal rim of the cloaca. There is no formal description of function other than what can be inferred from its name, “a sphincter of the cloaca.” We maintain that contraction of this muscle in concert with the M. piriformis depresses the urostyle and at the same time influences the volume and pressure of the pubic lymphatic sac which is the principal ventral–dorsal pathway for lymph returning from the hind limbs.M. cutaneus dorsi (Fig. 3c)This muscle originates on the connective tissue superficial to the ventral aspect of the pelvic disk and runs anteriorly and dorsally to an insertion on or along the dorsal margin of the lateral lymph sac close to the junction of dorsal, iliac, and femoral lymph sacs. It was described by Dugés (1834) as a tensor of the skin of the back. From a lymphatic perspective, contraction of this muscle will influence the volume and pressures of the lateral, iliac, and femoral lymph sacs. Its EMG activity is coincident with EMG activity of the M. piriformis and M. gracilis minor (Hedrick et al. 2007).M. cutaneus pectoris (Fig. 4a, b)These paired strap-like muscles originate near the third inscription of the M. rectus abdominus, from the anterior edge of the most posterior extent of the metasternal portion of the pectoral girdle. The muscles pass anteriorly and are relatively uniform in width until their insertion on the posterior margin of the pectoral lymph sac. Gaupp (1896) was the first to suggest a possible role in lymph movement in abdominal and pectoral lymph sacs. Tyler (1971) suggested the presence of this muscle throughout the Ranidae (sensu lato), but Drewes (1984) demonstrated its absence in the Hyperoliidae and suggested this loss might allow for increased expansion of the vocal sac during advertisement calling in some groups. Drewes et al. (2007) stated that contraction of the muscle will pull the central portion of the pectoral lymph sac septum posteriorly, increasing pectoral pressure (decreasing volume) and subsequently decreasing abdominal lymph sac pressure (increasing volume).Fig. 4Ventral view of origin (o) and insertion (i) of M. cutaneus pectoris in Lithobates catesbeianusa CAS 210381, skin reflected obliquely to show origin (o) at the lateral margin of the metasternum, and b insertion (i) along the posterior margin of the pectoral lymph sac (state 2, specimen uncataloged)M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenator complex (Figs. 5a–c, 6a–c)The M. gracilis minor is present in all anurans except the dendrobatid treefrogs of the genus Phyllobates (Dunlap 1960). Noble (1922) concludes “fossorial forms do tend to have greater expansion and attachment of the M. gracilis minor to the skin than do terrestrial or aquatic genera.” Dunlap (1960) examined 31 species of 15 anuran families (designations here are corrected to reflect those of Frost et al. (2006)) and tabulated three categories of the M. gracilis minor: (1) “Origin largely from pelvis” in one leiopelmatid (Ascaphus), two pipids, one scaphiopodid, a megophryid, a cycloramphid, a leptodactylid, a hylid, a centrolenelid, two ranids, and a microhylid; (2) “Origin largely from skin” in the other leiopelmatid genus, Leiopelma, a bombinatorid, and two alytids (but see GM\/AC character state 4, Fig. 6a, below); and (3) “Origin by two heads” (“one from the ischiac region of the skin and the other from the skin”) in two bufonids, two limnodynastids, two leptodactylids, a cycloramphid, a phrynobatrachid, and two rhacophorids. This muscle has gone largely unexamined in detail since Dunlap (1960); it is, in fact, the most variable of all of our proposed compliance pump skeletal muscles. Our work suggests that Dunlap’s (1960) description of a two-headed origin may be the result of this variation and\/or confusion with the M. abdominal crenator (Fig. 6b, c).Fig. 5Variation in the M. gracilis minor (G)\/M. abdominal crenator complex; all views are ventral with ventral skin reflected posteriorly; all specimens are oriented so that the top of each image is posterior. a State 1.

Pseudacris regilla (CAS–SU 13849), M. abdominal crenator present, originating (o) from pelvic rim, with minimal to moderate fanning and insertion (i) on the skin; M. gracilis minor has two components (see text). Origin of M. abdominal crenator and insertion of M. gracilis minor undifferentiated. c State 6. Anaxyrus terrestris (CAS–SU 8016) M. abdominal crenator (A) present, and its origin (o) well differentiated from insertion (i) of M. gracilis minor (see also Fig. 3b); fibers of both muscles broadly fanned and interdigitating at near right angles(x) (see text)Previously, the M. abdominal crenator has been referred to as an “accessory head” of the M. gracilis minor (e.g., Cannatella 1985). It has since been more extensively examined in members of the family Bufonidae and described as a separate muscle by Winokur and Hillyard (1992). We suggest the functional role of this muscle is to vary the volume and pressure within the interfemoral lymph sac, which is the most gravitationally dependent lymph sac of the thigh and which communicates directly with the pubic lymph sac. The pubic sac is the dorsal–ventral corridor for lymph passage from the hind limb to the posterior lymph hearts. Contraction of the M. gracilis minor expands the volume and decreases the pressure of the interfemoral lymph sac drawing lymph from the femoral lymph sacs of the thighs. Contraction of the M. abdominal crenator compresses the interfemoral lymph sac, raising the pressure necessary to move lymph vertically through the pubic lymph sacs to the posterior lymph hearts (Drewes et al. 2007). Hence, elaboration of the insertion of heads of this complex should more completely expand and compress the interfemoral lymph sac, increasing the driving force and lymph flux from the ventral gravitationally dependent regions of the hind limbs to the posterior lymph hearts.","Materials and methods\nThe morphologic variation in the muscles was determined by dissection of preserved specimens deposited in the collections of the Department of Herpetology, California Academy of Sciences as well as a number of other institutions. Over 400 individuals of 377 species were surveyed from 40 of the 42 families of anurans recognized in Frost et al. (2006) (material examined in Appendix 1). All museum acronyms in material examined follow Leviton et al. (1985). The phylogeny used to map this distribution is also that of Frost et al. (2006). We are aware that a number of well-supported lineages have since been recognized at the family level since Frost et al. (2006) but adhere to their 2006 phylogenetic construct (Fig. 2) to avoid errors in identification of material examined. Imagery was done by the BK 100 camera by Visionary Digital purchased under NSF IOS 0843082.","Results\nThe presence of skeletal muscles involved in lymphatic movement among the families of the anurans presented below is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nVariation in M. piriformisAll extant anurans possess the M. piriformis with the exception of some members of the aquatic family Pipidae (Fig. 2). In those pipid frogs where it is present, it is much reduced in mass (Hillman et al. 2011). The insertions of the M. piriformis on the urostyle are illustrated in Fig. 3a.Variation in M. sphincter ani cloacalisWe define three character states of this muscle.For all muscles, State 0 Absent.State 1 Sphincter ani cloacalis originates on connective tissue tightly adhering the skin to the posterior-most margin of the pelvic rim (cartilago marginalis of Gaupp 1896) and inserts on the dorsal surface of the M. compressor cloacalis (Fig. 3a).State 2 Muscle origin is dorsal to state 1 more attached to the pelvic rim and the muscle is more massive than state 1 (Fig. 3b).The distribution of character states of SAC is illustrated in Fig. 7. Fifteen of the 39 anuran families examined have multiple character states.Fig. 7The phylogenetic characterization of various character states for the M. sphincter ani cloacalis, M. cutaneus dorsi, M. cutaneus pectoris, and M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenatorThere is a significant correlation (p < 0.0001, Spearman r = 0.64) between number of character states contained within a family between the gracilis minor\/abdominal crenator and sphincter ani cloacalis. At the species level, there is also a significant correlation between these two muscles (p < 0.0001, Spearman r = 0.31).Variation in the M. cutaneus dorsiWe define four character states of M. cutaneus dorsi:State 0 The muscle is absent.State 1 Width of insertion spanning less than 2 times its width at origin.State 2 Width at insertion 2–3.5 times width at origin (Fig. 3c).State 3 Width at insertion 4 times or greater than width at origin.The distribution of this skeletal muscle is limited to the Ranoidea (it is absent in the Hyloidea) with the exception of the six representatives of the Australian family Limnodynastidae (Fig. 2). There was no significant correlation at the species level between the M. cutaneus dorsi and either the gracilis minor\/abdominal crenator complex (p = 0.65) or M. sphincter ani cloacalis (p = 0.44) (Fig. 8a–c).Fig. 8The frequency of various character states found in all the families (Fig. 7a) and the frequency of the number of character states contained in any family (Fig. 7b) for the M. sphincter ani cloacalis, M. cutaneus dorsi, M. cutaneus pectoris, and M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenatorVariation in the M. cutaneus pectorisThe M. cutaneus pectoris can be divided into three character states.State 0 The muscle is absent.State 1 Muscle is present, width at insertion less than one-third the distance between the ventral midline and origin of the fore limb.State 2 The width at insertion is twice or greater than the distance between the midline of the body and origin of the fore limb (Fig. 4a, b).This muscle is only present in Ranoidea and the more basal Megophryidae and Pelodytidae (Fig. 2). At the species level, there were no significant correlations between the M. cutaneus pectoris and M. cutaneus dorsi (p = 0.34). M. gracilis minor\/abdominal crenator (p = 0.11), and M. sphincter ani cloacalis (p = 0.13) (48 a, b, c).Variation in M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenator complexAmong derived families, this complex is comprised of two different skeletal muscles which, when both present, are coordinated in their activity as a single functional unit. This has physiological significance in large groups of anurans; thus, we assign character states irrespective of those cases in which one of these elements is always absent. We define six states of the complex:State 1 The M. abdominal crenator is absent; the gracilis minor (G) is an unmodified thigh muscle running parallel to and overlying the gracilis major with no functional association with the skin, that is, inserting on the pelvic rim only (Fig. 5a).State 2 The M. abdominal crenator is absent; the M. gracilis minor (G) is as in State 1 except that along its length there is connective tissue adherence to the skin overlying the margin of the interfemoral sac (Fig. 5b).State 3 The M. abdominal crenator is absent; separate ventral muscle fibers of the M. gracilis minor insert on the skin of the interfemoral lymph sac. In this state, there are various degrees of elaboration of the M. gracilis minor (Fig. 5c).State 4 The M. abdominal crenator is absent; in the M. gracilis minor, all fibers of the muscle insert solely on the skin overlying the interfemoral lymph sac. The M. gracilis minor does not reach the pelvic rim (Fig. 6a).State 5 The M. abdominal crenator is present originating from the pelvic rim with minimal to moderate fanning on the skin overlying the interfemoral lymph sac. The M. gracilis minor has two components: Some fibers running continuously from the knee to the pelvic rim, but most fibers inserting on the skin perpendicular to the fibers of the abdominal crenator. The origin of the M. abdominal crenator and the insertion of the M. gracilis minor on the pubic rim are undifferentiated (Fig. 6b).State 6 Separate origin of M abdominal crenator on the pelvic rim well differentiated from insertion of M. gracilis minor; the fibers of the abdominal crenator are greatly fanned and insert on the skin. The majority of the fibers of the gracilis minor insert on the skin and are likewise greatly fanned. They interdigitate at near right angles with the fibers of the abdominal crenator at their insertion overlying the interfemoral lymph sac. Some fibers of the M. gracilis minor remain continuous from the knee to insertion on pelvic rim (Fig. 6c).There is a broad range of variation of the M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenator complex character states among the anuran families examined (Fig. 8a). The frequency of the character states within each family is illustrated in Fig. 8b. We suggest that the plesiomorphic state of this complex is state 4, which has a low frequency of occurrence but is widely present in the most basal lineages and rare among derived groups (Fig. 2). Seventeen of the 39 anuran families examined have three or more character states within them (Fig. 8b), and 26 of the 39 have multiple character states within them.","Discussion\nIn an attempt to achieve as broad a phylogenetic perspective as possible, our study includes 377 species of 40 of the 42 families recognized by Frost et al. (2006); it represents the largest if not the only analysis of these muscles. However, we include only about 8 % of the currently described extant species and thus recognize that there may well be far more variation than we have described.\nMany of the skeletal muscles examined that participate in the movement of lymph show a wide variation in size, mass, and insertional patterns. For a number of these muscles, no function has been previously proposed.\nThe amount of variation in size and configuration of a number of the muscles studied was unexpected. However, much of our knowledge of anuran myology is derived from the multiple and combined works of Alexander Ecker, Robert Wiedersheim, and Ernst Gaupp (1864–1904) which were wholly based on two species of the genus Pelophylax (Rana) both of which exhibit state 2 of the M. gracilis minor. This muscle has generally been overlooked in terms of alternative function beyond locomotory (except Winokur and Hillyard 1992). In fact, the family Ranidae actually includes four of the six different and distinct states of this muscle, some quite striking and clearly not related to locomotion.\nSome of the muscles described above in our compliance pump model (see also Hillman et al. 2004) show either limited variation (M. piriformis) or are clearly distributed with phylogenetic bias (M. cutaneus pectoris, M. cutaneus dorsi) and thus have limited value in the determination of form and function. However, there are muscles that show a high degree of structural variation that appear across the anuran phylogenetic spectrum. These allow us to make phylogenetically independent determinations of form and function.\nBased on our data, the most robust model with which to test form and function is the highly correlated variations in the M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenator complex and the M. sphincter ani cloacalis, since the relationship occurs across multiple lineages. Our synthesis of this variation suggests that the ancestral condition of the complex includes state 4 of the M. gracilis minor (Fig. 6a), since this state occurs mainly among the most basal extant lineages. In addition, the correlation reported above suggests that the ancestral state of the M. sphincter ani cloacalis is state 1. This would indicate that evolution of this system has been bidirectional and has included both the loss and elaboration of the muscles involved.\nFunctionally, we interpret increased insertion width and numbers of heads as enabling a more dispersed transmission of force to the skin and more effective compression of the attendant lymph sac. This would increase the pressure in the lymphatic sac increasing the rate of lymph movement from that sac. Data exist for the rate of lymph mobilization from the femoral lymphatic sac for three species: Rhinella marina, Lithobates catesbeianus, and Xenopus laevis (Hillman et al. 2011). Lymph moves from the femoral lymph sac to the interfemoral to the pubic lymph sac to ultimately reach the posterior lymph hearts (Hillman et al. 2004). The M. gracilis minor\/M. abdominal crenator complex (GM\/AC) and the M. sphincter ani cloacalis (SAC) play a major role in generating the force necessary to move the lymph from the femoral sac dorsally to the posterior lymph hearts. The rate of lymph flux in the three species is R. marina > L. catesbeianus > X. laevis. These flux rates are correlated with the degree of development of the muscles in the GM\/AC and SAC: R. marina (GM\/AC 6, SAC 3) > L. catesbeianus (2,1) > X. laevis (1,0) (Hillman et al. 2011). These data indicate that elaboration of these muscles from the presumptive ancestral state results in increased lymphatic flux, while loss or reduction of the muscles results in a decreased capacity to move lymph. These three species span the environmental gradient from terrestrial to aquatic.\nAnother way to test this statement is to analyze variation within anuran families exhibiting multiple states of these characters in order to determine whether there is an environmental correlation. Four anuran families show wide variation for both the GM\/AC and SAC: Megophryidae, Limnodynastidae, Hylidae, and Microhylidae. Among the Megophryidae, the lowest character state scores for the GM\/AC and SAC are found in the genus Oreolalax (1,1); the highest are found in Scutiger sikimmensis (4,2). Both appear to inhabit similar riparian, forested habitats. In the Limnodynastidae, the lowest scores occur in Limnodynastes tasmaniensis (2,1) and the highest in Platyplectrum ornatum and Notaden melanoscaphus (5,3; 6,1). L. tasmaniensis is an inhabitant of riparian habitats; P. ornatum and N. melanoscaphus are both burrowing forms. The hylid species with lowest scores is Litoria moorei (3,1) and the highest is Corythomantis greening (6,3). L. moorei is mainly aquatic while C. greeningi is scansorial in dry savannah conditions. Among the microhylid frogs examined, the lowest scores are found in Chaperina fusca (1,1) and the highest in Kalophrynus pleurostigma (6,2). C. fusca inhabits rainforest habitats, while K. pleurostigma is leaf-litter terrestrial form in drier habitats. These results are suggestive but not conclusive with respect to any correlation of the development of these muscles and habitat.\nSeveral of the muscles included in this study have distributions that indicate a phylogenetic bias. These include the M. cutaneus pectoris and the M. cutaneus dorsi. Presence of character state 3 of the M. cutaneus dorsi only occurs in the families Hemisotidae and Microhylidae. The variation found in the M. cutaneus pectoris does not appear to be related to the ecology of the species possessing it.\nThis study represents the first attempt to extensively characterize the range of variation present in these lymphatic pump skeletal muscles. We suggest that the amount of variation present in these lymphatic skeletal muscles should provide a fruitful model to delineate the environmental selective pressures responsible for creating functional differences in mobilizing lymph from the posterior regions of anurans. Such an analysis requires the ability to objectively characterize the ecology and correct for phylogenetic constraints for multiple species. Characterizing the range of variation present in each of these muscles represents the first step in building such a dataset.","Electronic supplementary material\nSupplementary material 1 (DOC 158 kb)"],"title":"Evolutionary implications of the distribution and variation of the skeletal muscles of the anuran lymphatic system"},
{"pmid":"24459326","sections":["Introduction\nThe Hemiptera are characterised by a deep modification of their buccal apparatus\ninto a rostrum consisting of the labium guiding two pairs of respective mandibular\nand maxillar stylets allowing their penetration into feedings tissues. For\nmechanical efficiency, these stylets are morphologically more or less strongly\ncoapted through interlocking devices. This mouthpart connecting system, which has\nbeen variously investigated according to the major Hemiptera taxa (Pollard\n1968, 1972; Forbes and Raine 1973; Forbes 1977;\nCobben 1978), has attracted new recent\ncomparative analysis showing that it consists in a two- or three-locked system\nbetween the right and the left maxilla, surrounded by the two mandibles sometimes\ninterlocked with the maxillae and the whole bunch being guided by the labium groove\n(Brożek and Herczek 2001, 2004; Brożek et al. 2006; Brożek 2006,\n2007). Between the maxillary stylets,\na dorsal alimentary and a ventral salivary canal are generally present.\nA preliminary study of few representatives in some Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha\nfamilies has shown that the connecting system consists in a three-locked connecting\nsystem between the maxillae but also that some diversity in the shape of mandibles\nand maxillae should be of possible phylogenetic interest (Brożek et al. 2006). However, no further attempts were made to\ninvestigate more carefully these structures within a single family, and to evaluate\nhow much these conformations observed were diverse at lower taxonomic levels. More\nparticularly in Cixiidae, these first investigations have shown that the mandibulae\nwere moon-crescent-shaped, of regular form (e.g. larger in cross-section in their\nmid-part) and joining dorsally and ventrally in a more or less rounded acute ending.\nA differently shaped system was observed in representatives of Delphacidae,\nDerbidae, Issidae, Caliscelidae and Lophopidae, which exhibited mandibles more\ndeveloped ventrally (in cross-section) and with a wide ventral junction area.\nMoreover, as for Cixiidae, Issidae and Lophopidae maxillae were observed fully\nsurrounded by the mandibles, while they were left freely exposed on their dorsal\nmargin in all the other previously cited taxa and the Achilidae representative\n(Brożek et al. 2006).\nObjectives in this study were therefore (1) to enlarge the scope of the\nmorphological study of the mouthpart connecting system to some other planthopper\nfamilies in order to better evaluate the interest of this new set of morphological\ncharacters for future phylogenetic studies in planthoppers; (2) to select a set of\nnew identified characters and their states that should be useful to document in the\nfuture when describing new potential key taxa in the Fulgoroidea or even higher; and\n(3) to investigate, particularly within one planthopper family, whether any\npolymorphism of the connecting system is expressed as it is known to occur in\nHeteroptera for instance (Cobben 1978).\nUntil now, the Cixiidae monophyly still remains controversial and non-supported\n(Ceotto and Bourgoin 2008; Ceotto et\nal. 2008) and new character data sets\nare necessary to better assess this taxa. This is why the Cixiidae model was chosen\nas a good candidate to test the phylogenetic signal carried by the character\nselected in the labium in relation with the published internal classifications of\nthe Cixiidae (Emeljanov 2002; Ceotto\nand Bourgoin 2008; Ceotto et al.\n2008).","Materials and methods\nThe study of the internal structures of the mouthparts was performed on dry\nmaterial from the collections of the Museum National d’Historie Naturelle in Paris\n(MNHN) and of the Department of Zoology, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.\nThe specimens are mainly Cixiidae, but several representatives of other family taxa\nwere also included; all are listed in\nAppendix together with the species previously studied in other\npapers.\nThe internal structures of mouthparts were analysed through cross-section of the\nsubapical labial segment of adult specimens. For scanning microscopy, the basal part\nof the head with a part of the labium was glued vertically, coated with a 65–70 μm\nfilm of gold–palladium and then photographed with a Jeol JSM III scanning electron\nmicroscope.\nTerminology of the connecting system between maxillae and mandibles in the\nCixiidae, at the level of the subapical segment, is presented in Fig. 1 and follows Brożek et al. (2006). Characters and states selected as of being\nof interest are noted [Kn (state number)] in the text. All of them are presented in\nTable 1 and have been illustrated with\ntheir different states in Fig. 11.

In few cases (Borysthenes and Achaemenes), it even appears to be almost twice as wide as\nhigh.Mandibular–maxillar and maxillar–maxillar interlocking systemsIn all the specimens examined, the mouthpart interlocking\/connecting apparatus\nconsists of a three-locked maxillar–maxillar system—dorsal, median and\nventral—between the right (RMx) and the left (LMx) maxilla, surrounded by the two\nmandibles; the whole bunch surrounded by the labium (Fig. 1). The mandibles (RMd, LMd) are placed laterally\nwith respect to the maxillae. Special device to interlock the mandibles with the\nmaxillae (Fig. 11 [K2(1)], IMMD) was not\nobserved [K2(0)], and the regularly convex external walls of the maxillae are able\nto slide along the concave internal and smooth surfaces of the mandibles. However,\nmost often, the general shape of the interlocked maxillae prevents their free\nrotation within the case surrounded by the two mandibular stylets (see further in\nthe “Discussion”).MandibulaeIn cross-section, mandibular stylets are more or less crescent-shaped and are\na mirror image to each other [K16(0)]. They exhibit a high disparity of shapes\n(Fig. 2) that allow to recognise several\nspecific mandibular characters for their description. Global shape: axis of their\ngreater width appears to be perpendicular to the dorsoventral axis in all cixiids\nstudied, tettigometrids and the achillid Ballomarius (Figs. 10a,\n11 [K3(0)]) versus oriented\nlateroventral in all other Fulgoroidea studied (Figs. 10b, 11 [K3(1)]). Global\ndevelopment: in general, the mandibles are more than two to three times longer\nthan wide [K4(0)]. In Betacixius ocellatus,\nthey are distinctly wider, less than two time as wide as long [K4(1)].\nLaterodorsal external margin shape: generally regularly convex [K5(0)] in most\ncixiids versus slightly concave laterodorsal [K5(1)] as in Pintalia sp., Bothriocera sp.,\nachilids, the flatid Flata and the ricaniid\nPochazia or even more complex as in Cubana sp., [K5(2)]; and with a latero-concave slip\n(sl) [K6(1)] as observed in Cubana sp.,\nAchilla marginatifrons, Flata pallida or\nLophops africana. The shape of the dorsal and\nventral tips can be acute, tapered, flattened short or flattened wide [K7,\nK8].Fig. 2Types of the mandible shapes in the cross-section in the\nCixiidae: a\nBorysthenes lacteus. b\nBetacixius ocellatus. c\nBrixidia boukokoensis. d\nBrixidia variabilis. e\nBrixia rosae. f\nPintalia sp. g\nCubana sp. h\nAchaemenes lokobensis. i\nCixius nervosus. j\nCixius cunicularius. k\nMacrocixius giganteus. l\nTachycixius pilosus. m\nMnemosyne camerunensis. n\nMnemosyne lamabokensis. o\nPentastiridius moestus. p\nHyalesthes obsoletus. q\nMundopa kotoshonis. r\nMyndus taffini. s\nBothriocera sp. t\nOliarus kindli.\nDT dorsal tip, VT ventral tip, A acute,\nT tapered, FS flattened short, FW\nflattened wideAlmost all combinations between these last two characters have been observed:\nboth dorsal and ventral tips acute (A) as in Borysthenes\nlacteus (Figs. 2a,\n3a, 5a); dorsal tip tapered (T) and ventral tip flattened short (FS)\nas in Betacixius ocellatus (Figs. 2b, 3t,\n6f); both dorsal and ventral tips\ntapered (T) as in Brixidia boukokoensis\n(Figs. 2c, 3c, 5c), B. variablis (Figs. 2d, 3d, 5d, e), Brixia\nrosae (Figs. 2e, 3e, 5f),\nPintalia sp.

(Cixiinae: Pintaliini).\nt\nBetacixius ocellatus (Cixiinae:\nSemonini)Finally, the two mandibles can be or not in contact both dorsally [K9] and\nventrally [K10]. When dorsal tips are flattened, the two mandibular stylets are\nalways dorsally in contact in Cixiidae (Fig. 3b, g–q). Similar junction was not observed in other\nplanthoppers. When dorsal tips are acute or tapered, they might be in contact as\nin Borysthenes, Brixidia, Bixia, Achaemenes and Betacixius (Fig. 3a, c–f, t)\nor not as in Pintalia and Cubana (Fig. 3r, s,). Ventrally and whatever their shapes, ventral tips are\ngenerally not in contact with Cixiidae excepted in Brixia, Macrocixius, Tachycixius, Mundopa, Myndus and Mnemosyne (Fig. 3e, i–l, p, q).MaxillaeIn cross-section, maxillae in Cixiidae are generally flattened laterally,\ntogether representing a more or less oval assemblage [K11(0)] higher than wide\n(Fig. 3b–d, g–t). The assemblage looks\nalmost rounded [K11(1)] in the cixiid Borysthenes (Fig. 3a) and\nAchaemenes (Fig. 3f) as well as in some other planthoppers such as the tropiduchid\nTrienopa (Figs. 7g, 8i) or the flatid Flata\npallida (Figs. 7i,\n8j) or the caliscelid Ommatidiotus (Fig. 7l). In non-cixiid planthoppers observed, the two interlocked\nmaxillae are also laterally compressed in the Tettigometridae (Figs. 7a, b, 8a,\nb), Achilidae (Figs. 7c, d, 8c, d) and Lophopidae (Figs. 7p, 9f), but\nin most cases, they form a cordiform assemblage more acute ventrally than dorsally\n[K11(2)] (Figs. 7e, f, h, j, k, m–o,\n8f–h, k, l, 9a–e). In Nisia and Numicia (Figs. 7e, f, 8f, h), the dorsal\nmargin is distinctly concave [K14(1)].Between them, the maxillae delimit two canals: the ventral salivary canal (SC)\nmore or less fully included in the right maxilla and the dorsal alimentary or food\ncanal (FC), which is wider and formed by the junction of the two maxillar stylets.\nThese are joined along their entire length through the connecting apparatus. In\nall cixiids and planthoppers studied, in cross-section, the junction line between\nthe two maxillae runs parallel to the dorsoventral axis [K12(0)].Maxillar connecting apparatusIt is formed by a triple interlocking complex structure [K15(0)] of special\ninternal arms bringing together variously shaped maxillar ridges (in this study\nreferred to as processes) and grooves (Fig. 1):Four processes form the dorsal lock. On the left maxilla: the upper\nhooked one (A′) and the lower straight one (B′), and on the right maxilla:\nthe upper straight one (A) and the lower hooked one (B). Between A and B′,\nA′ and B interlock (Fig. 1).The median lock is formed by three processes: the two hooked processes\n(C, D) of the right maxilla interlock with a T-shaped process (C′) of the\nleft maxilla (Fig. 1).The ventral lock is formed only by two processes: the hooked E process\non the right maxilla interlocks with the slightly hooked E’ process on the\nleft maxilla (Fig. 1).No variation was observed for the dorsal and median locks, while in the\nventral one, the right E process appears to be more or less developed [K13] and\ntherefore enclosing the salivary canal more or less completely:E process is considered as short [K13(0)] when its tip slightly overlaps\nthe E′ process and does not reach up the base of the C′ process. In this\nconformation, the salivary canal is more or less equally closed by both the\nright and the left maxilla (Fig. 4a). This situation is observed in most cixiid species as in\nBorysthenes lacteus (Figs. 3a, 5a), Bothriocera sp.\n(Figs. 3b, 5b), Brixidia\nboukokoensis, B. variabilis (Figs. 3c, d, 5c–e) and\nBrixia rosae (Figs. 3e, 5f), and some Cixiini as in Cixius\nnervosus, C. cunicularius, Macrocixius giganteus, Tachycixius\npilosus (Figs. 3g–j,\n5h–l), the Pentastirini (Oliarus kindli, Pentastiridius moestus, Hyalesthes\nobsoletus, Figs. 3m–o,\n4a), the Mnemosynini (Mnemosyne camerunensis, M. lamabokoensis, Figs. 3p, q, 6g, h) and\nthe Oecleini (Mundopa kotoshonis,\nFigs. 3k, 6a; Myndus\ntaffini, Figs. 3l,\n6b).Fig. 4Length of the process E on the right maxilla of the\nCixiidae. a Short, b middle, c longFig. 5Detail of the cross-section through the subapical rostral\nsegment of Cixiidae is presented based on scanning photos: a\nBorysthenes lacteus\n(Borystheninae). b\nBothriocera sp.

Recently, a comparative analysis of the\nsystems has been undertaken (Brożek and Herczek 2004; Brożek et al. 2006; Brożek 2006,\n2007). A surprising morphological\ndiversity starts to emerge from these original studies, and a series of character\nappears to be of interest for further investigations. They will have to be included\nin morphological data set built for future phylogenetic analysis both from the\nHemiptera level down to the family level, at least in planthoppers.\nStylet bundleIn all Cixiidae studied, the stylet bundle is dorsoventrally compressed (wider\nthan high) (Fig. 11. K 1(1)]). This is\nalso the case in most planthoppers excepted in the representatives of\ndictyopharid, fulgorid and lophopid (Fig. 11. K 1(2)]) studied here. In flatids, the two states are\nobserved: dorsoventrally compressed in Flatida\nsp. (Fig. 7h) and rounded in Flata pallida (Fig. 7i).Fig. 7Shape of the maxillae and mandibles in cross-section of the\nrepresentatives of the fulgoromorphan families: a\nTettigometra sulphurea. b\nHilda sp. c\nAchilla marginatifrons. d\nBallomarius kawandanus. e\nNisia nervosa. f\nNumicia hulstaerti. g\nTrienopa paradoxa.\nh\nFlatida sp. i\nFlata pallida. j\nCalyptoproctus sp. k\nDictyophara europaea. l\nOmmatidiotus dissimilis. m\nPochazia antica. n\nPeregrinus maidis. o\nDiostrombus gangumis. p\nLophops africana. Abbreviations as on\nFig. 1\nSome diversity is observed in other Hemiptera lineages: dorsoventrally\ncompressed in Coleorrhyncha (Brożek 2007), in families of Cicadomorpha (Brożek in prep.) and most\nbasal Heteroptera (Cobben 1978). It\nis of equal length (as wide as high) in Heteroptera Pentatomomorpha and\nCimicomorpha (Brożek and Herczek 2004)\nor strongly laterally compressed (wider than high) in Sternorrhyncha\n(Fig. 11 [K1(0)]): Aphididae, Psyllidae\nand Aleyrodidae (Forbes 1969,\n1972; Cobben 1978) and Coccinea (Brożek 2006).As noted by Cobben (1978), no\nclear relation can be found between these different shapes of stylet bundle and\nfeeding habits. The fact that all investigated cixiids and most other planthoppers\nare dorsoventrally compressed might indicate that this character state represents\nthe plesiomorphic state.Mandibular–maxillar and maxillar–maxillar interlocking systemsFor obvious functional reasons, maxillae and mandibulae have to maintain a\nsmooth longitudinal slide between them, but efficiency of the system grows with\nthe closer mechanical coordination of all the stylets due to additional\ninterlocking devices. No such supplementary interlocking device [K2] was noticed\nbetween the stylets as it has been reported in many Heteroptera (Cobben\n1978; Brożek and Herczek\n2004). It would mean that in several\ncases, the mandibles might rotate around the maxillae at least on a short\ndistance. However, this rotation remains blocked in most cases as soon as the\nconcavity of the external maxilla margins is no more circular or if the maxillae\nare not symmetrical [K11].This is particularly the case in most of the cixiids studied here, but also in\ndelphacids, achilids, meenoplids, tettigometrids, tropiduchids, fulgorids,\ndictyopharids and lophopids representatives (Brożek et al. 2006). Only in the cixiid Borysthenes, and in Flata pallida\n(Flatidae), Ommatidiotus (Caliscelidae) and\nTrienopa (Tropiduchidae), circular\ninterlocked maxillae have been observed (Brożek et al. 2006). Some limited rotation of the interlocked\nmaxillae within the mandibular case might be possible for these taxa as also\nreported by Cobben (1978) for\nGerromorpha even if in these taxa the lateral margin of the maxillae is irregular\n(op. cit. Fig. 143a, 147a, c) and the freedom of the connected maxillae is allowed\nby a slighter coordination of the mandibles and maxillae.In other terms, planthoppers have developed a different morphological solution\nthan in Heteroptera for the maxillar–mandibular interlocking system, without\nadditional morphological device but just through a shape modification of their\nstylets. This planthopper system remains plesiomorphic and is much probably less\nefficient than the heteropteran one where these maxillar–mandibular locking have\nevolved.MandibulaeAs already mentioned by Cobben (1978), the mirror image of the two mandibules [K16 (0)] is a\ngeneral condition for the Hemiptera excepted in the Sternorrhyncha [K16 (1)]. In\nthis respect, and following Cobben hypothesis (1978: 236) that each mandibular stylet have evolved in opposite\ndirection (or that one mandibule has evolved with some special adaptation),\nplanthoppers share a probable plesiomorphic conformation with the other\nAuchenorrhyncha, Coleorrhyncha and Heteroptera. In planthoppers, they are usually\nmore or less crescent-shaped while they exhibit a high disparity of shapes. In all\nCixiidae studied, stylets are regularly convex on their external margin with their\nwider development passing through an axis perpendicular to the dorsoventral one\n(Figs. 10a, 11) [K3(0)].Excepted in the cixiid, the achilid Ballomarius and the tettigometrids, in all other planthoppers\nexamined, the mandibulae use be more developed ventrally. The mandibulae is\ngenerally two to three times as high as wide [K4]; exceptionally in Betacixius, it is particularly wide, almost as it is\nhigh (Fig. 2b). In a few cixiid specimens\n(Fig. 2s) and in some other\nplanthoppers, the dorsal marge [K5] is no more rounded, but concave as in achilids\n(Fig. 7c, d), flatid Flata sp. (Fig. 7i), ricaniid (Fig. 7m)\nand the lophopid (Fig. 7p) or irregular as\nin Cubana sp. (Fig. 2g, K5(2)). A distinct laterodorsal concave slip [K6] can be\nobserved in Cubana, in the achilid Achilla margninatifrons (Fig. 7c), in the flatid Flata\npallida (Figs. 7i,\n8j.) and in the lophopid Lophops (Figs. 7p, 9f). This slip\ncorresponds to two lateral ridges along the mandibles that probably help to guide\nthe stylet bundle inside the labium but also prevent its rotation.Fig. 8Cross-sections through the subapical rostral segment of the\nfulgoromorphan families: a\nTettigometra sulphurea\n(Tettigometridae). b\nHilda sp.

It is interesting to observe that in all cixiids, maxillae are\nalmost fully surrounded by the mandibles [K9], while in most other planthoppers\nstudied, the mandibles do not join dorsally, leaving free the dorsal margin of the\ninterconnected maxillae (Fig. 7b, c, e–p).\nThis condition is also general in Sternorrhyncha. As dorsally, the two mandibles\nmight or not join ventrally [K10], even if the mandibles are strongly developed\nventrally as in the flatids (Figs. 7i,\n8j) for instance. Accordingly, maxillae\nalmost fully surrounded by the mandibular case as in the Cixiidae might represent\na synapomorphy for the taxa [K9]. The special case of the Pintalini as observed in\nPintalia sp. and Cubana sp. represents probably another evolutionary step.A tapered or flattened mandibular ventral tips seem to be a derived state in\nthe Fulgoromorpha as not observed elsewhere in Hemiptera. In this respect, the\nparticular condition observed in the one cixiid Borysthenes (acute ventral and dorsal tips) might be considered as\nautapomorphic reversals for each of these taxa.MaxillaeIn cross-section, maxillae are generally flattened laterally, together\nrepresenting a more or less oval assemblage [K11(0, 1)] longer than wide\n(Fig. 3b–e, g–t). As earlier mentioned,\nthis transversal oval shape of the maxillae prevents the free rotation of the\ninterlocked maxillar stylets inside the case formed by the two external mandibular\nstylets. In the other planthoppers observed, the two interlocked maxillae are also\nlaterally compressed (Tettigometridae, Achilidae, Lophopidae) and in most cases\nform a cordiform assemblage [K11(2)]. In addition, the ventral development of the\nleft maxillar stylet (E′ process) can also interlock ventrally between the two\nmandibles as in Tachycixius or Achaemenes where it appears to be more strongly\ndeveloped. This double system prevents any rotation of the maxillae inside the\nmandibular case (Fig. 3f). This\nconformation participates to the interlocking apparatus and to the efficiency of\nthe functionality of the connecting system.It is interesting to note that in a few taxa as in the meenoplid Nisia (Figs. 7e, 8f) and the tropiduchid\nNumicia (Figs. 7f, 8h), the dorsal\nmargin of the interlocked maxillae is widely exposed and concave [K14 (1)]. It is\nnot known at present whether a corresponding labial structure exists.In all the planthopper taxa investigated (Brożek 2006, this study), the maxillar connecting system consists in a\nthree-locking apparatus [K15(0)]. Such a condition appears to be plesiomorphic for\nthe Hemiptera as exemplified in most Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha (Pollard\n1968; Forbes 1977; Cobben 1978; Brożek 2006),\nFulgoromorpha (Brożek et al. 2006),\nand Coleorrhyncha and Heteroptera (Cobben 1978; Brożek and Herczek 2004; Brożek 2007)\n(Fig. 10a–e). Only in Cicadomorpha\n(Fig. 11, [K15(1)]), an apomorphic two\nlocking system between the maxillae is observed (Brożek and Herczek 2001). This character is connected to the\nlocation of the salivary canal confined to the left maxillary stylet in\nSternorrhyncha [K17(0)] as already documented by Cobben (1978).Fig. 10Axis of greater width in mandibles. a Fulgoromorpha (Achilidae, Tettigometridae, Cixiidae).\nb Other Fulgoromorpha. c Coleorrhyncha. d Heteroptera: Nepomorpha. e Heteroptera: Pentatomomorpha. f Sternorrhyncha. g\nCicadomorpha.

Each of them represents a tribe in the Cixiidae or another\nplanthopper family by including the previous data from Brożek et al. (2006). This analysis does not suppose to provide\na phylogeny hypothesis of these taxa but rather to test whether the mouthpart\ncomplex allows some classification of these taxa into already recognised groups or\nwhether the morphological message is too complex due to too much homoplasy, and\ntherefore uninformative at this hierarchical level analysis. In other terms, this\napproach allows to observe and analyse the phylogenetic information of this set of\ncharacters restricted to the mouthparts as quoted in the matrix of\nTable 2, not being disturbed by the\nnoise of the homoplasy carried by any other characters that will have been\nintroduced into a parsimonious congruency analysis including other character sets.\nAs one could expect it, the analysis did not produce any reliable result (too much\ntaxa, too few characters) and resulted with strong polytomies. However, using\nMesquite, we forced the tree topology to recover a classical Hemiptera phylogeny\nas in Bourgoin and Campbell (2002). On\nthe base of a Sternorrhyncha Euhemiptera basal division and a polytomious\nEuhemiptera: Heteroptera, Coleorrhyncha, Cicadomorpha and Fulgoromorpha, the most\nparsimonious solution was therefore looking for within the Fulgormorpha and the\nCixiidae.Obviously, some of these internal mouthpart characters appear to be of\ninterest to be included in future morphological phylogeny studies of both\nFulgomorpha and Cixiidae phylogenies. Particularly:K3: all planthoppers except Cixiidae, Tettigometridae and the achilid\nBallomarius exhibit mandibular stylets\nmore developed ventrally than dorsally.K7: all planthoppers including Cixiidae have a plesiomorphic mandibular\ndorsal tip tapered (Fig. 12).\nWithin Cixiidae, Bothriocerinae, Oeclini and Pentastirini have a mandibular\ndorsal tip wide and flattened, while it remains short and flattened in all\nCixiini.Fig. 12Parsimonious character state analysis of [mandibular\ndorsal tip] plotted on Hemiptera phylogeny according to Bourgoin and\nCampbell (2002)K8: all planthoppers except Cixiidae, Achilidae, Tettigometridae and\nDerbidae have a mandibular ventral tip tapered. In all other planthopper\nfamilies, it is wide and flattened. A probable homoplasic conformation,\nflattened short is approached in Bothriocerinae and Oeclini\n(Fig. 13).Fig. 13Parsimonious character state analysis of [mandibular\nventral tip] plotted on Hemiptera phylogeny according to Bourgoin\nand Campbell (2002)K9: the mandibular case dorsally closed by joined mandibulae with the\ndorsal margin of maxillae not freely exposed represents a probable\nsynapomorphy for all Cixiidae, excepted form the Pintalini where the dorsal\nmargin of the mandibulae is not regularly convex (K5).","Conclusions\nThe study has revealed an unexpected disparity of the mouthparts in the\nrepresentatives of the different tribes of the Cixiidae, but also between them and\nsome other planthopper families more generally. It shows the interest to investigate\nfurther these morphological diversities for future phylogenetic studies in\nplanthoppers. Accordingly, a new set of identified characters and their states has\nbeen established (Table 1) to be documented\nin potential key taxa in the Fulgoroidea in the future. It is likely that it will\nhave to be completed when more species will be examined.\nThe overall result does not contradict what it is generally admitted for the\nphylogeny of Fulgoromorpha (Bourgoin et al. 1997; Urban and Cryan 2007; Song and Liang 2013) and Cixiidae (Emeljanov 2002; Ceotto and Bourgoin 2008; Ceotto et al. 2008) even if none of these papers agrees together. The grouping\ntogether of most Cixiidae excepted in the Pintalini (which seems to exhibit several\nautapomorphies within the Cixiidae) versus the other planthoppers is congruent with\na monophyletic Cixiidae taxa, as proposed by Emeljanov (2002) and Ceotto and Bourgoin (2008).\nThe study has shown that the evolution of the mouthpart structures does appears\nneither uniform nor anarchic, and that their study, extended to more taxa in other\nplanthopper taxa, should deliver additional phylogenetic information that will be\nuseful for future morphological phylogenetic studies of this group.\nIn the future, it will be interested to investigate further if these data,\ntogether with other mouthpart structures such as the recently studied labium\nsensilla in planthoppers (Brożek and Bourgoin 2013), could be linked to some possible diet structures or explain\nshift in patterns of trophic relationships as it has been observed in planthoppers\n(Attié et al. 2008)."],"title":"The phylogenetic information carried by a\nnew set of morphological characters in planthoppers: the internal mouthpart structures\nand test in the Cixiidae model (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha) "},
{"pmid":"22958281","sections":["Introduction\nEmerging infectious diseases in wildlife threaten global biodiversity and public health (Daszak et al., 2000). Bats can host a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. In addition to rabies (RABV) and other lyssaviruses (e.g. Kuzmin et al., 2008b; Streicker et al., 2010), bats have been identified as the likely reservoir for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) (Li et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007), Hendra (HeV) (Halpin et al., 2000), Nipah (NiV) (Chua et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2004; Reynes et al., 2005), Ebola (EBOV) (Leroy et al., 2005) and Marburg (MARV) viruses (Monath, 1999; Peterson et al., 2004a,b; Towner et al., 2007). Most recently, a new distinct lineage of influenza A virus has been discovered in little yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium, family Phyllostomidae) in the Americas (Tong et al., 2012) and a range of paramyxoviruses in bats from four continents (Drexler et al., 2012). Given the potentially devastating effects of these emerging diseases on public health and wildlife conservation (e.g. EBOV and gorillas; Bermejo et al., 2006), it is crucial that we improve our understanding of how bat ecology may influence disease dynamics and their propensity to serve as reservoirs for emerging pathogens (Messenger et al., 2003; Calisher et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2007).\nEcological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, can be a complex mixture of processes (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, 2009). Clearly, human activities that increase exposure to bats will increase the opportunity for infections to be transmitted between bats and humans or to intermediate hosts such as pets and livestock. However, our knowledge of how and why emerging pathogens spill over from bats is limited, and improved understanding of these processes will require cross-disciplinary approaches. Traits of the pathogen and the human–pathogen interactions at the cellular level, such as evolutionary mutation rates and receptor-binding affinity, are important when trying to understand spillover and emergence (Moya et al., 2004; Pulliam, 2008; Pulliam and Dushoff, 2009). However, these traits are proximate causes, and the ultimate drivers of spillover and emergence are ecological (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009). Therefore, understanding host ecology and elements of the human–animal interface are essential in the context of pathogen spillover events. For example, host population structure and seasonality may affect the dynamics, viral diversity and virulence of infection in the host population, which may in turn affect the risk of spillover (Boots et al., 2004; Turmelle and Olival, 2009). Attempts to understand how host ecology impacts the dynamics of infection are relatively few in wild animal populations and fewer still for bat populations, and attempts at understanding how infections themselves evolve to persist in wildlife hosts with different ecologies are rarer still. To understand the role of host ecology in disease dynamics, we recommend combining field and experimental methods iteratively to parameterize mechanistic models, as well as integrative modelling in a comparative context, between species, population cohorts and pathogens (Plowright et al., 2008b; Plowright et al., 2011; George et al., 2011); important also in this context is the use of models to prioritize and plan field studies (Restif et al., in press). Only once host and pathogen ecologies are united, can reliable predictions be made regarding ecological drivers of spatiotemporal infection dynamics and spillover (Keeling and Rohani, 2008).\nInfection dynamics in bats are likely influenced by the unique ecology of this diverse group of mammals. There are several ways in which bats differ from other similarly sized mammals, including potential for rapid and widespread dispersal, highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and high survival, with low fecundity (Calisher et al., 2006). The majority of the studies on bat infections to date have focused on bats and zoonotic viral infections, but the ecological generalities may be similar among bacterial (Kosoy et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2011) and fungal infections of bats (e.g. Histoplasma capsulatum, Geomyces destructans) (Taylor et al., 2005; Blehert et al., 2009; Frick et al., 2010; Foley et al., 2011; Puechmaille et al., 2011). Although widely recognized, few studies have involved explicit hypothesis testing regarding pathogen associations and the unique ecological characteristics of bats.\nIn this article, we review how interactions between the ecologies of the host(s) and pathogen drive the infection dynamics within host populations and highlight the importance of considering both when investigating spillover events and dynamics. However, there is currently a paucity of studies on the ecology of bat infectious diseases, sometimes leading us to reference some studies in multiple contexts. Therefore, we end each section with a summary of the key unanswered questions relating to the ecology of bats and their infections, then make suggestions as to how future research could address these questions.","Host Ecological Strategies Driving Bat Infection Dynamics\nMany aspects of wildlife biology are strongly seasonal, and the ecological strategies that hosts use for coping with seasonal variability may influence disease transmission (Altizer et al., 2006) and emergence. Seasonal host dynamics may be coupled to disease dynamics in, and emergence from, bats by influencing contact rates and susceptibility of the population to infection. Major mechanisms for coping with seasonality in temperate zone bats include restricted birthing periods, migration, use of coloniality and torpor. Each of these strategies may affect population density, contact rates and immune response, thus leading to spatiotemporal variation in infection dynamics. Prevalence of rabies viruses (RABV), CoV and astroviruses (AstV) in bats has been reported to exhibit seasonal dynamics (Mondul et al., 2003; Drexler et al., 2011; Patyk et al., 2012). Changes in the seasonal timing of RABV prevalence among bats in particular appear to correlate with ecological characteristics of the host species (George et al., 2011). However, mechanistic explanations of how host ecological strategies for coping with seasonal variability influence infection dynamics in bats are largely lacking.\nHost reproduction and survival as major drivers of bat disease dynamicsMany species of bats in both temperate and tropical zones exhibit highly synchronized parturition (Mutere, 1968; Fleming et al., 1972; Heideman et al., 1992; Bernard and Cumming, 1997; Racey and Entwistle, 2000; Porter and Wilkinson, 2001; Greiner et al., 2011), which can dramatically alter population contact rates and susceptibilities for short time frames. The influx of susceptible young is a crucial driver of infection dynamics (Anderson and May, 1979). However, the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown, and only rare examples exist in the literature. Simulations of spatial models of raccoon rabies in the USA, a relatively well-studied system, suggest that increasing seasonality in births as latitude increases leads to increasingly asynchronous rabies dynamics (Duke-Sylvester et al., 2011). Hosseini et al. (2004) were able to demonstrate that seasonal breeding of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), along with seasonal social aggregation and partial immunity, was key in explaining the specific semi-annual pattern of prevalence seen in Mycoplasma gallisepticum conjunctivitis. Many bat species also show marked differences between the sexes in distribution and behaviour during the warmer months, including the use of torpor (discussed below) and degree of coloniality (Cryan et al., 2000; Senior et al., 2005; Weller et al., 2009). Sex differences in behaviour and distribution of bats during times of year when the potential for disease transmission is greatest may also have important implications for disease dynamics, although typically behaviour and population demographic data exist for only a single sex (Weller et al., 2009; O’Shea et al., 2010; Kerth et al., 2011).Unlike other emerging diseases of bat origin, there is considerable background field and laboratory information on bat RABV; however, even with this relative wealth of information, it was only recently that attempts were made to understand how host ecological strategies influence infection maintenance (Dimitrov and Hallam, 2009; Dimitrov et al., 2008; George et al., 2011). Turmelle et al. (2010a) showed empirically contrasting temporal patterns of RABV exposure in Tadarida brasiliensis at different types of roosts during the reproduction season, which suggested increased RABV exposure after parturition in cave colonies. Specifically, cave colonies in this system are known to harbour up to a million individual bats (Betke et al., 2008), mostly reproductively active females, leading to a short window of time where population size doubles following parturition, and contact rates between adult and newborn bats are elevated during early lactation. Individual- and roost-level variation in physiological stress was also demonstrated in this system (Allen et al., 2011), although direct impacts of stress on susceptibility or immune response of bats to RABV or other pathogen infections have not been well characterized to date (but see Smith, 1981).In modelling RABV in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Colorado, George et al. (2011) found that interaction between the timing of the annual birth pulse and the RABV incubation period (extending through torpor) was important for RABV perpetuation in the bat population. Host survival rates were important, particularly during hibernation when lower mortality rates facilitated host population persistence, as was the seasonal pulse of susceptible juveniles entering the population in summer (O’Shea et al., 2010, 2011b). Thus, George et al. (2011) were able to show that seasonality in both births and deaths were important factors in RABV persistence E. fuscus. Plowright et al. (2011) examined the transmission dynamics of HeV in Australian pteropid bats using a mathematical model parameterized with field and laboratory data. The authors speculated in models of HeV in Australia that it was population connectivity and immunity that played a key role in the infection dynamics, rather than a simple influx of naïve young. It is noteworthy that incorporating waning maternal immunity into models describing HeV–Pteropus interactions provided a better fit to the data, therefore demonstrating that not only does the influx of naïve young affect disease dynamics, but that the rate of inflow of susceptible hosts is important in driving pathogen dynamics.A 3-year study of CoV, AstV and adenoviruses (AdV) in a colony of Myotis myotis in Germany demonstrated that RNA viruses (CoV and AstV), but not DNA viruses (AdV), were strongly amplified during colony formation and after parturition and that bat population and virus dynamics were correlated (Drexler et al., 2011). This study also suggested that the breeding success of the colony was not affected by CoV or AstV and that these viruses had seemingly little pathogenic influence on bats, although the lack of individual tracking and follow-up precludes conclusive evidence to support this idea. However, Drexler et al. (2011) concluded that the correlation between bat and virus dynamics suggested that both coloniality and a birth pulse of susceptible hosts may be important for infection dynamics of RNA viruses.Migration and coloniality as major drivers of bat disease dynamicsDifferent species of bats manifest distinctive differences in both migratory behaviour (e.g. long distance versus restricted local movements) and population density within colonies (e.g. hundreds per square metre versus solitary or very small groups), yet the impact of such differences in terms of disease dynamics have not been well studied. The majority of bats in temperate zones also cycle between summer maternity roosts and winter hibernacula, and population density, sex and species composition can vary widely between these two types of seasonal roosting aggregations. Indeed, the effects of often very different behaviours between male and female bats (Weller et al., 2009) and the role of increased contact during mating seasons have yet to be explored in relation to infection dynamics. Tropical, non-hibernating bats may use migration and coloniality for other reasons, for example, to track the seasonal availability of fruit and flowers (Thomas, 1983; Richter and Cumming, 2006). As fission–fusion social structures are increasingly being recognized in bats (Storz et al., 2001; Kerth et al., 2011), these may interact with other life history traits to have a profound impact on pathogen transmission rates and persistence.Seasonal variation in the prevalence of infection is likely impacted by changes in density during migration or colony formation, which affect contact rates and thus disease dynamics (Altizer et al., 2011). Some of the clearest examples of how seasonality and ‘coloniality’ may affect and drive infection dynamics come from human systems. The episodic dynamics of measles epidemics in the absence of vaccination, for example, driven by school terms (Finkenstadt and Grenfell, 1998; Finkenstadt et al., 1998) or fluctuating agrarian systems (Ferrari et al., 2008; Bharti et al., 2011) suggest changes in contact rates of susceptible hosts may be key in driving infection dynamics. As mentioned, Hosseini et al. (2004) also demonstrated that seasonality in coloniality was important for predicting Mycoplasma dynamics in house finches. Although not zoonotic, in bat systems G. destructans dynamics and the current epidemic in North America appear to be especially driven by coloniality and migration (Frick et al., 2010). Comparative studies may help to elucidate the impact of variation in seasonal ecologies among or within species affected by the same species or variant of pathogen. For example, the seasonality in aggregation and population dynamics of big brown bats in relation to maintenance of RABV in temperate Colorado (George et al., 2011) could differ in warm temperate and tropical areas where the host species also occurs (Kurta and Baker, 1990; Turmelle et al., 2011).Assuming a metapopulation model of connectivity, models of HeV predicted that decreased migration of Pteropus bats in Australia, possibly because of urbanization and changes in food availability, could influence the intensity and duration of HeV epidemics (Plowright et al., 2011). Decreased migration could give rise to more intense but shorter HeV outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. The mechanism proposed for such an increase in epidemic intensity was that decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in transmission between colonies and, therefore, reduced inter-colony exposures and resulting immunity within colonies. This proposed loss of immunity leads to increased epidemic size and more rapid fade-out once infection is re-introduced into a susceptible colony. Thus, reduced migration and population connectivity were suggested as a mechanism that could increase the amplitude of the seasonal outbreaks and increase the probability of spillover. This relationship may be relevant to a variety of bat-associated pathogens, where hosts exist as a metapopulation and humans alter connectivity of populations.Use of torpor as a major driver of bat disease dynamics and seasonalityMany species of bats are facultative heterotherms capable of using deep torpor during periods of physiological stress to offset energy and water deficits (Humphries et al., 2002; Speakman and Thomas, 2003). For tropical species, reliance on short-term and shallow torpor to offset energy deficits is less well described and may be more prevalent than is currently appreciated (Coburn and Geiser, 1998; Stawski et al., 2009; Stawski and Geiser, 2010). The role of torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied (Bouma et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2011). Species of bats that differ in their use of migration also often differ in their use of torpor. Torpor typically reduces pathogen replication rates (Sulkin et al., 1960; Luis and Hudson, 2006) and hence lengthens incubation periods (Bouma et al., 2010) and prevents host contact; these in turn influence the seasonal force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals contract infection). Additionally, it likely provides an efficient mechanism for overwintering of some infections.Multidisciplinary studies, using both experimental data and integrative mathematical models, can be used to determine the importance of temporal changes in torpor use in driving temporal changes in infection prevalence, as was done by George et al. (2011). We argue that the effects of both torpor and changes in contact rates during migration and colony formation might only be differentiated using mechanistic process models. George et al. (2011) found a clear indication for torpor being a key factor in allowing perpetuation of RABV through the hibernation period, through prolonged incubation period and reduced mortality; this enabled RABV infection to persist in the population until susceptible individuals from the annual birth pulse could become infected and continue the cycle. However, RABV is also capable of perpetuating in a variety of bat hosts that are not known to utilize torpor, and even the same host species under varied ecological circumstances (i.e. warmer tropical climates), which begs the question of which factors allow RABV to avoid population fade-out under these circumstances (see Dimitrov et al., 2007, 2008).An interesting but non-zoonotic example of the importance of torpor on pathogen dynamics is white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats. The associated fungus G. destructans has been detected in 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, and WNS disease has been linked to the deaths of more than five million bats in North America (Blehert et al., 2009; Frick et al., 2010). The causative psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus colonizes the skin causing devastating lesions by eroding, digesting and replacing living skin tissues with the large surface areas of bat wings being the primary target of infection (Cryan et al., 2010). Hibernation depresses all physiological processes, including immunological processes (Bouma et al., 2010), and thus during deep torpor G. destructans, which grows only at temperatures <20°C, is able to replicate more efficiently than would be possible in a bat that has aroused or does not utilize torpor to the same degree. Thus, although G. destructans may show the opposite temperature pattern of infection to RNA viruses, it emphasizes the potential importance of torpor on infection dynamics.Future directions for research to address the role of host ecological strategies in driving bat infection dynamicsLongitudinal infection and demographic data are required to understand how birth, survival, coloniality, migration and torpor affect infection dynamics within bat populations. Frequently, researchers monitor one part of the process, such as survival (Papadatou et al., 2011), infection (Drexler et al., 2011; Field et al., 2011) or seroprevalence (Breed et al., 2011). However, some studies captured long-term longitudinal data. Hayman et al. (2012a,b) concurrently monitored each in Eidolon helvum African fruit bats, and George et al. (2011) and Plowright et al. (2011) synthesized demographic data with infection-related data from field and laboratory studies to give insights into potential mechanisms that drive infection dynamics. Capture–recapture data should be collected to allow estimation of both demographic parameters (O’Shea et al., 2011a,b; Papadatou et al., 2011; Hayman et al., 2012b), while age-specific infection data are particularly useful because they allow such estimation of factors, such as force of infection (Hayman et al., 2012a). Similarly, host population genetic data can be informative to measure connectivity between bat populations, as has been done for NiV and HeV (Olival, 2008). Studies should also attempt to capture the seasonal variation, such as pre-, during- and post-parturition and migration or hibernation seasons, and consider the potential effects of often very different migratory behaviours between male and female bats of some species (Weller et al., 2009). In all cases, however, longitudinal sampling of individuals in experimental and\/or captive studies may be required to interpret field-related data. For example, Sulkin et al. (1960) demonstrated that torpor prevents viral replication for the duration of hibernation, and, along with describing antibody titre decays, Rahman et al. (2011) demonstrate that recrudescence of NiV may occur in bats, which may be used to interpret field data. Statistical and mechanistic models, such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based models (see Box 1), can then be used on these data to determine which factors best predict infection dynamics. Comparison of mechanistic models, using careful statistical approaches to determine model fitting (Restif et al., in press), may be required to ascertain whether seasonal birth pulses or changes in contact rates, modelled as step functions (e.g. Duke-Sylvester et al., 2011) or seasonal forcing (e.g. Hosseini et al., 2004) for example, drive infection dynamics. Meta-population models may be required to capture all aspects of the system (e.g. Plowright et al., 2011), but must also take into account what is observed in small isolated populations (Peel et al., 2012).Box 1 Classifying bat populations into susceptible (S), exposed (i.e. incubating infection; E), infectious (I) and recovered (immune; R) classes allows analysis of infection dynamics in bat populations. Three alternative model structures used to model the lyssavirus transmission period for different bat populations and their lyssaviruses are shown. Parameters are as follows: b-birth rate; β-transmission coefficient; γ-rate of recovery (seroconverstion); ε-disease-induced mortality; d-’natural’ mortality; ρ-probability of infection causing disease(A) The SIR model structure used by Amengual et al. (2007) to understand possible asymptomatic European bat lyssavirus-1 infection dynamics in Myotis myotis bats.(B) The SEIR model structure used by George et al. (2011) to understand rabies virus (RABV) dynamics and persistence in Eptesicus fuscus. Three ‘seasons’ were modelled: spring birthing\/pre-transmission; summer transmission (with this structure) and winter hibernation (with no transmission).(C) The SEIR structure used by Dimitrov et al. (2008) to understand how different immunotypes of host allowed RABV persistence in Tadarida brasiliensis bats and how RABV might select for different immunotypes in populations. N is population size (= S+E+I+R). Differing infectivity and mortality rates, d, were modelled, and infection and transmission or recovery was modelled with individual-based models.","Multispecies, Multipathogen Dynamics\nVery few studies in any wildlife system have adequately described either multihost pathogen dynamics or multipathogen dynamics in a single host species. This is hardly surprising given the complexities involved in understanding single pathogen–single host dynamics. However, there are important studies that suggest both multihost and pathogen dynamics are important in other non-bat systems, and empirical data that suggest these situations may occur in bat infection systems. Through analysis of time series data, Telfer et al. (2010) demonstrated statistically that in a parasite community, including a virus, protozoan and two bacteria, within individual field voles (Microtus agrestis), risk of infection was altered by concurrent infection to a greater extent than by age or season. Lello et al. (2004) demonstrated that, in a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population, gut helminth community parasites either compete or exist in mutualistic relationships. Few studies have considered multiple infections in bats (Drexler et al., 2011). Muhldorfer et al. (2011) detected infections in 12% of 486 bats from 19 European bat species, detecting co-infection with herpesviruses in five bats, but were unable to infer much from this study as it was based on opportunistic sampling. Also, in Thailand, two distinct clades of Nipah virus were found to circulate in the same colony of the fruit bat, Pteropus lylei (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2010)\nFrom a multihost community perspective, Davies and Pedersen (2008) found that host-relatedness and geographical range overlap were significant predictors of pathogen sharing among primates. Some viruses, notably RABV, are promiscuous, infecting multiple host species. Streicker et al. (2010) demonstrated that although RABV variants predominantly circulate within single host species, they are able to spill over into other species. Similar to Davies and Pedersen (2008), Streicker et al. (2010) documented highly asymmetrical patterns of cross-species RABV transmission in the North American bat fauna, with host-relatedness and geographical range overlap being the strongest predictors of cross-species transmission, thus also suggesting an important influence of host sympatry. Whether these factors affect cross-species transmission of other lyssaviruses within Chiroptera, or from bats to other mammals, is not known, because isolations are often few and serological findings may be due to cross-reactivity between related species or variants, complicating interpretation (e.g. Wright et al., 2010). European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2 (EBLV-1, EBLV-2) appear to show a very narrow host range in Europe. EBLV-1 circulates in Serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) and EBLV-2 in Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii); this host fidelity is, however, not complete, as the first isolation of EBLV-2 was from a Pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), and in Spain, EBLV-1 sequences have been recovered from several bat species (Serra-Cobo et al., 2002; Amengual et al., 2007). The importance of cross-species transmission events in seasonally changing communities may vary with respect to pathogen or variants of a pathogen, but is not really clear for any system. In some cases, infection cycles may be maintained in co-roosting species without cross-species transmission. For example, Kuzmin et al. (2011) discovered that Commerson’s leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni) is a possible reservoir of Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV, a lyssavirus), while Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and Miniopterus spp. bats in the same caves were seropositive against Lagos bat virus (LBV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) (Kuzmin et al., 2008b), thus suggesting that at least for these lyssaviruses, infections may circulate among specific host species and transmission may be minimal among sympatric bats. Moreover, Cui et al. (2007) reported clustering of CoV sequences from geographically separated Vespertilionid bats of the same species, even for co-roosting bats. Coronaviruses from Rhinolophidae bats, however, did not share this feature and appear to have undergone a number of host shifts.\nFuture directions for research to address the role of multiple hosts in infection dynamics and multiple pathogens in infection dynamicsResearch programmes that focus on multiparasite and\/or multihost systems, following the approach described previously, will help advance our understanding of the ecology of bat diseases. Particular care is needed to consider the markedly reduced statistical power available when considering the dynamics of co-infections, and modelling to help plan empirical data collection would be particularly beneficial for such studies (Restif et al., in press). These studies could particularly benefit from community ecology approaches, testing for inter-specific interactions, such as described by Telfer et al. (2010). Additionally, more detailed molecular techniques and robust co-evolutionary studies could be incorporated that tease out cross-species transmission events (e.g. Cui et al., 2007; Streicker et al., 2010) and infection dynamics (e.g. Drexler et al., 2011).","Host Ecological Strategies as Drivers of Pathogen Virulence\nFactors relating to the use of torpor and migration, as well as spatial structure, may select for different optimal levels of virulence in bats, which are long-lived and may acquire immunity to diseases such as RABV (Turmelle et al., 2010b). Intrahost pathogen replication is generally very temperature-dependent, and so seasonal torpor usually suspends it (Sadler and Enright, 1959; Sulkin et al., 1960; Luis and Hudson, 2006). Thus, species and sex differences in torpor behaviour may affect the coevolution of pathogen variants and their transmission rates and generation times (i.e. lineage birth and death processes). Boots et al. (2004) showed theoretically how large shifts in virulence may occur in pathogen populations. They modelled infection in long-lived species that acquire immunity following infection, and as a result of bi-stability in evolutionary dynamics caused by the host’s local contact or social population structure, large shifts in virulence could be predicted (Boots et al., 2004). Furthermore, Boots and Sasaki (1999) demonstrated that greater potential for long-distance spread of the pathogen can increase virulence by reducing local selective pressure on the pathogen by exhausting the supply of susceptible hosts from a population. More work, both theoretical and empirical, is required to understand these phenomena in natural host populations. Gandon (2004) used theoretical models to predict the effect of multiple hosts on infection virulence. Interestingly, Gandon’s work predicts that if an infection adapts to the most abundant host, then it may well be maladapted to other, less frequent hosts, and this maladaptation may lead to avirulence or hypervirulence in the new or less common host. Thus, decreased inter-species transmission leads to pathogen adaptation to a more abundant host species, whereas increased inter-species transmission leads to more generalist virulence strategies. These theoretical findings may be especially interesting for studies of bats, because of the very large colony sizes that some bats can reach.\nDespite these theoretical studies, there is currently little empirical evidence for bat host ecology affecting pathogen virulence. The best example comes from RABV, where up to 30 different lineages of bat RABV may exist in the United States (Messenger et al., 2002; Streicker et al., 2010), and it appears that different bats maintain host-specific RABV variants within populations (Shankar et al., 2005; Streicker et al., 2010). Following the control of canine rabies, the majority of indigenously acquired human rabies infections in the United States are attributable to RABV variants associated with bats (Messenger et al., 2002, 2003). It is unclear whether this mortality from bat rabies is from unrecognized exposure (e.g. humans being bitten during sleep and so not obtaining post-exposure prophylaxis) or is owing to differences in properties of RABV variants; however, some data are suggestive of the latter. Most human rabies deaths in the United States during the past decade are linked to variants associated with the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans; almost exclusively this species in the western United States) and Perimyotis subflavus, the tricoloured bat (Krebs et al., 2000a,b; Messenger et al., 2003; Franka et al., 2006). In most cases of human rabies associated with bat RABVs, there is no definitive bite history (Rupprecht et al., 2002). The high proportion (74%) of human rabies cases attributable to bat RABV variants cannot be explained by a higher frequency of exposure to these species, as they tend to be non-synanthropic. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for this phenomenon: 1) the RABV variants associated with L. noctivagans and P. subflavus are widespread among bat populations and moving through undetected host reservoirs; 2) these variants are more infectious than others. Streicker et al. (2010) provided evidence that neither variant dominates spillover infections into other bat hosts, as indicated by the relatively low proportion of cross-species infections detected with these RABV variants. Concerning the latter hypothesis, laboratory studies suggested higher in vitro pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness of the variant associated with L. noctivagans than in a variant isolated from carnivores (Morimoto et al., 1996; Dietzschold et al., 2000; Faber et al., 2004); however, further studies are required because of the uncertain host origin of one of the viruses isolated from a human case (I. Kuzmin, personal communication). However, studies have not adequately investigated comparative pathogenicity in vivo in bats relative to the diversity of bat RABV variants that persist naturally (but see Turmelle, 2009).\nLasionycteris noctivagans belongs to a unique group of long-distance latitudinal migrants that roost in trees throughout the year (‘tree bats’). Ecological strategies of tree bats differ from other bats in North America and likely drive RABV dynamics in unique ways. Although there were no dominant RABV variants, Streicker et al. (2010) show a propensity for tree bats to asymmetrically infect other bat hosts with RABV. RABV variants associated with tree bats are also among the most recent to emerge (Franka et al., 2006). The winter habits of L. noctivagans are poorly known, but intermittent torpor with frequent activity at lower latitudes is likely (Geluso, 2007). Females migrate to higher latitudes in North America during spring and summer while males tend to migrate shorter distances and occupy mountainous regions (Cryan, 2003), and small colonies of adult females and offspring are believed to form in summer (Parsons et al., 1986; Mattson et al., 1996; Betts, 1998). Almost nothing is known about male group sizes (but they are presumed to be solitary) or survival rates. However, L. noctivagans appears to be an ideal species to include in comparative studies to elucidate the effects of host ecology on pathogen virulence and test Boots and Sasaki’s (1999) theoretical work. Virulence factors and life history traits should also be compared to P. subflavus, which has recently been described as a migratory species (Fraser et al., 2012) and whose RABV variant also causes a disproportionately large proportion of human RABV cases in the USA.\nFuture directions for research to address the role of host ecological strategies in driving pathogen virulence.While some theoretical models are more advanced than field data in predicting virulence, spatial mechanistic meta-population models using parameters estimated for bats and their infections are required to determine whether highly mobile hosts can select for virulent infections. The effects of torpor, or other host factors affecting immune response, on virulence have yet to be explored, even theoretically. However, to determine the importance of host ecological strategies in pathogen virulence, experimental infection studies are required (e.g. Halpin et al., 2011); measurement of pathogen virulence (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates in hosts) is required using isolates of pathogens from migratory and non-migratory species and from those using torpor. This could be achieved using multiple isolates that are representative of the diversity bat RABV reservoirs. Ideally, results from one system (e.g. lyssaviruses) should be confirmed in others, such as the CoVs and AstVs that have been detected in bats. Studies to address the theoretical findings of Gandon (2004) will need to use infections of a common host and experimentally compare morbidity and mortality in this and other less common bat species.","Pathogen Ecology as a Driver of Bat Disease Dynamics\nIt is possible that the dramatic differences in migration, coloniality and torpor among bat hosts may lead to the evolution of different pathogen adaptation strategies. The differences in pathogen infection strategies (e.g. mode of transmission and virulence) and pathogen variants associated with particular hosts may drive disease dynamics beyond differences in the ecology of hosts themselves. Hampson et al. (2009) found that no matter what density of dogs was involved in an outbreak, canine RABV epidemics always had an R0 (which is the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population, Keeling and Rohani, 2008) of <2. Therefore, one might speculate that pathogen ecology drove RABV dynamics in dogs as much as host demography. Most emerging infections from bats are RNA viruses (Leroy et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Calisher et al., 2006; Towner et al., 2007). RNA viruses have a high capacity for mutation compared with DNA viruses due especially to the low proofreading ability of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that controls replication (but see Firth et al., 2010). Therefore, mutations can appear and be fixed in a short period of time relative to the host’s evolutionary time frame (Moya et al., 2004). Variation in virulence, infectivity and other important processes can therefore potentially be altered within a relatively short evolutionary timescale and change the infection dynamics. However, the pathogen’s ecology must also balance factors that affect transmission, such as virulence, epidemiological ‘burn-out’ and mechanisms for persistence in complex host populations (e.g. Pulliam et al., 2011).\nThere is little empirical evidence for differences in virulence among viruses of the same genus in their bat hosts, although the phenomenon of differing virulence among virus variants classified taxonomically as a single species is nearly universal. Studies on LBV by Markotter et al. (2009) demonstrated variable virulence among isolates when mice were challenged with different LBV isolates, as did studies with silver-haired bat RABV (Dietzschold et al., 2000). Evidence of differing virulence in humans exists for EBOV, with Reston and Cote d’Ivoire ebolaviruses not known to have caused fatal human infections (for review, see Morikawa et al., 2007), whereas other EBOV viruses and MARV have case fatality rates up to 90%. However, the virulence of these viruses in bats (the putative reservoirs) is less well described, but may be low (Swanepoel et al., 1996; Leroy et al., 2005; Towner et al., 2007). Similarly, experimental studies of henipaviruses in bat hosts have shown that in laboratory situations these viruses do not exhibit high virulence in their putative reservoir hosts (Middleton et al., 2007; Williamson et al., 1998, Williamson et al., 2000; Halpin et al., 2011) in contrast to their impacts on other species.\nMaintenance strategies used by RABV and CoV, for example, clearly differ. While both have spilled over into humans and caused fatal infections (SARS-CoV perhaps through an intermediate host), they exhibit strong differences in ecological strategies. Both CoV and RABV have been detected in E. fuscus (Shankar et al., 2004, 2005; Dominguez et al., 2007); however, RABV infection has a low detectable prevalence, but high fitness impact on bat hosts when cerebral infection occurs, whereas CoV appears to have high infection prevalence, but a low fitness impact on bats (Drexler et al., 2011; Osborne et al., 2011). These groups of viruses also differ in modes of transmission, but both are likely transmitted through very close or direct contact of hosts. To understand infection emergence, it is necessary to understand the importance of how traits may differ between infections, with resultant differences in disease dynamics; these might then be predictable based on host and infection ecology. However, little is known about the transmission and virulence characteristics of most bat infections, and clearly, this is an important area for future study.\nFuture directions for research to address how pathogen ecology drives infection dynamics.Large-scale analyses of epidemics, such as for dog rabies (Hampson et al. (2009), will be impossible until large and comparative data sets exist for bat infections. There are few estimates of R0 in the literature for any wildlife infection; however, Drexler et al. (2011) have shown how multiple infections can be monitored at the population level for bats and serological data can be used to estimate parameters such as force of infection (Hayman et al., 2012a). Other than steps proposed earlier to fill these data gaps that exist for almost all bat systems, it is likely necessary that further studies of within-host dynamics, and therefore experimental studies, are necessary to inform how pathogen ecology affects infection dynamics. Experimentally measuring pathogen shedding and transmission of infections with different ecological strategies in a single host may determine whether those with higher virulence (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates in hosts) have higher shedding, whereas those with lower virulence have lower shedding, but less fitness cost. These data can thus inform interpretation of field data and be used in mechanistic models.","Methods to Integrate Data and Compare the Epidemiology of Infections in Bats\nWe propose that multidisciplinary approaches are required to address bat ecology and disease dynamics. Detailed integrative modelling of disease dynamics in bats requires data and input from ecologists, bat biologists, pathogen experts, virologists, molecular biologists and epidemiological modellers. Integrating all these different disciplines, often through the modelling studies, is a substantial effort, often requiring a high level of technical expertise. The insights into infectious disease dynamics that can be derived from integrative modelling studies can, however, be profound, and there is a real need for more of such efforts to be undertaken. Mechanistic models also have the advantage of suggesting critical data gaps. Integrative models, such as SEIR models (Box 1), can be used to test different hypotheses, based on the relative sensitivities of parameters in the models (e.g. Buhnerkempe et al., 2011; George et al., 2011). These models can be used to predict how the impact of host and infection characteristics varies among sexes, species and diseases. In addition, quantification of the impact of other ecological characteristics can be assessed (George et al., 2011), such as bat reproduction and survival (O’Shea et al., 2004, 2010, 2011a,b), or differences in seasonal prevalence among pathogen variants. If pathogen dynamics can be significantly explained by host ecological strategies despite differences between the pathogens, it will suggest that the dynamics of emerging diseases in bats might be generally predictable from ecological characteristics.\nCyclical changes in contact and transmission rates have been suggested as the causative mechanism of temporal patterns for a variety of diseases and have been investigated using modelling approaches (Childs et al., 2000; Begon et al., 2003, 2009). Models of bat infection dynamics (for examples, see Box 1) should, therefore, integrate hypotheses regarding seasonal behaviours, including migration, coloniality and torpor use, in order to determine the effects of seasonality on disease dynamics. This approach has helped reveal the relative importance of transmission mechanisms in a plague prairie dog system (Webb et al., 2006), environmental transmission of avian influenza (Rohani et al., 2009) and in a bat RABV system (George et al., 2011). Another set of bat RABV models has been developed, but focuses largely on more detailed immunological hypotheses (Dimitrov et al., 2007, 2008), whereas other models demonstrate how altered migration behaviour may result in declining immunity within specific colonies, which can lead to more explosive HeV epidemics (Plowright et al., 2011).\nIf migration and coloniality are important drivers of disease dynamics, the timing and prevalence of infection are likely highly sensitive to parameters influencing rates of contact either within (George et al., 2011) or between (Plowright et al., 2011) colonies in models. Likewise, if torpor is an important driver of disease dynamics, then timing and prevalence of infection are likely highly sensitive to parameters influencing incubation period and resistance (George et al., 2011).\nFuture direction for integrative modelling of bat infection dynamics.One of the major factors prohibiting the modelling of infection dynamics in bats is the lack of appropriate data, and steps to mitigate this deficiency are described in previous sections. We have proposed elsewhere (Restif et al., in press) that for the most parsimonious study design, allowing integration of field and experimental data into models that test different hypotheses, a model-guided fieldwork approach should be undertaken. Here, model structures based on an understanding of the biology of the host and the infectious agent are used to design field studies; this should force researchers to be explicit about what is known in the system. Simulations and sensitivity analyses can be used to test differing hypotheses and parameter sensitivities, which can help the interpretation of field and laboratory data and direct future empirical data collection.\nFurther studies should also take comparative approaches, using models of similar but differing systems. For example, although bat hosts of RABV and other lyssaviruses vary in some host ecological strategies, such as in the use of torpor, the question arises as to whether common traits, such as seasonal birth pulses, can be used to predict the infection dynamics across lyssavirus systems. If so, this will provide a powerful insight into the drivers of infection dynamics, so general predictions regarding infection ecology and spillover can be made.","Challenges to Understanding the Ecology of Infectious Agents and their Bat Hosts\nThere are substantial difficulties in performing these integrated and multidisciplinary studies in most bat–pathogen systems, including those associated with pathogen detection, time series data collection and significant variation in host ecological parameters, both within and among species. The detection of infections with low prevalence, such as those caused by some RNA viruses, can be very difficult and may require non-random sampling, very large sample sizes, specialized techniques or a combination of all three (e.g. Leroy et al., 2005; Kuzmin et al., 2008b). The detection of EBOV RNA in bats is one clear example (Leroy et al., 2005). It took decades to discover EBOV RNA in bats, despite intensive efforts and epidemiological and experimental evidence linking the infection to bats (Swanepoel et al., 1996; Monath, 1999; Pourrut et al., 2005), and to date, the viruses are yet to be isolated by cell culture from any bat. Furthermore, although bats were strongly implicated as reservoirs to SARS-like CoVs and diverse lineages of CoVs have been detected from bats globally, to date there has been no CoV isolate from bats because of the non-permissive nature of extant cell culture systems.\nTime series data are requisite for tackling complexities in inter-annual variation in disease ecology, but efforts to collect them can be immense. Drexler et al. (2011) studied a maternity colony of M. myotis bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighbourhood in Germany, during 2008, 2009 and 2010. This was an elegant study; however, it was only performed on a single maternity colony and only for a short period of each year; furthermore, samples and data were only available at the population scale. Similar population-level studies have been reported for HeV and NiV in Australia and Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010; Field et al., 2011). All three of these studies, however, captured seasonality in viral shedding. Case submission data have also been used to capture seasonality, such as for RABV submissions used by George et al. (2011); however, these data are biased (see Klug et al. 2011) and unlikely to be relevant for infections with low mortality in the host. Studies looking for individuals shedding infection have been less successful. For example, Hayman et al. (2012a) failed to detect lyssavirus RNA in oral swabs from 796 E. helvum bats sampled over four years. Despite seemingly large overall sample size, the individual sampling events were unlikely to detect low infection prevalence and were further reduced when the authors accounted for the testing process sensitivity. If detection of the infection can be difficult, determination of the mode of transmission, periods of infectiousness and rates of recovery can be even more challenging and often require experimental studies. However, experimental studies in bats, such as those with RABV and other lyssaviruses (Hughes et al., 2006; Franka et al., 2008; Kuzmin et al., 2008a; Turmelle et al., 2010b), EBOV (Swanepoel et al., 1996) and HeV (Williamson et al., 1998) can be very costly, usually involve small sample sizes and highlight the complexities of host response to infection (Franka et al., 2008; Turmelle et al., 2010b; Halpin et al., 2011). Additionally, measuring morbidity and mortality in animals experimentally infected with potentially highly pathogenic infection can raise difficult ethical questions. Although not without their own ethical issues, initially, standard mouse models may be instructive, because they are of known infection history, genetically homologous (thus reducing host heterogeneity that might obscure mechanistic trends), and there are a range of immune markers available that do not exist for bats; however, studies using mice will not address important questions on dynamics of infection in natural hosts. Further difficulties exist in testing some hypotheses, because though apparently widespread in bats, infection such as CoVs and AstV are yet to have been propagated in the laboratory.\nComplications also arise when attempting to estimate vital host-related parameters. Birth rates are generally measurable, but mortality rates and the causes of mortality are particularly challenging to determine in wild populations (O’Shea et al., 2004). Generally capture–mark–recapture methods are used for estimating mortality rates; however, these studies are difficult, especially with migratory species or species with large colony sizes (Hayman et al., 2012b). Determination of the true age of wild bats is also difficult once bats reach maturity, making life table analyses intractable (life table approaches can also have analytical shortcomings; Williams et al., 2002). Hayman et al. (2012a) used tooth cementum annuli to age bats and determined that age-specific seroprevalence against LBV and estimated force of infection increased with age (Hayman et al., 2012a). However, this was a destructive process (canine teeth were used) and the sample size small.\nThe quantification of seasonal and sex differences in coloniality, torpor and migration is difficult because of peculiarities in the ecology and life histories of bats themselves. Typically, adequate information only exists for parts of the year (one particular season; Hayman et al., 2012a,b; Drexler et al., 2011) or one particular sex (Weller et al., 2009; Drexler et al., 2011). For example, information exists on summer colony sizes of E. fuscus and activity patterns of females, but not males; however, population genetic studies have shed some light on sex-biased patterns of dispersal in this species (Nadin-Davis et al., 2010; Turmelle et al., 2011). For other species, such as E. helvum, migration patterns are largely unknown, so information is only available from colonies that are conspicuous for parts of the year (Sorensen and Halberg, 2001; Richter and Cumming, 2006, 2008; Hayman et al., 2010, 2012a,b). Studying non-migratory colonies of some species may provide insight into the relative effects of migration and other ecological factors (Peel et al., 2012). However, group and population sizes themselves may be very difficult to determine (Kunz, 2003), and roosting dynamics may be hard to quantify. Individuals in large colonies are difficult to identify and count, and small colonies may be inconspicuous (Weller et al., 2009). Often, only roosting or foraging behaviour is known, and tracking over long distances requires more labour-intensive methods, such as tagging with wing bands or following bats fitted with radio transmitters using fixed-wing aircraft (Cryan and Diehl, 2009). Precise GPS or satellite tracking systems are currently too large for long-distance tracking of all but the largest bat species (Smith et al., 2011), although these studies have shed light on movement of Pteropus in the context of NiV and HeV dynamics (Epstein et al., 2009; Breed et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). The use of infrared video cameras has recently been utilized to monitor roost entrances and count the number of bats that emerge each night and associated host thermal energetic profiles (Hristov et al., 2008; Reichard et al., 2010a, 2010b), however, these systems are costly and in their infancy with respect to general use.\nAdvances required to improve the understanding of infection ecology in bats.Far wider use of capture–recapture techniques is required to obtain estimates of host survival and infection-related parameters. While manual capture has distinct advantages, such as allowing sampling of individuals to obtain infection-related data, it may be impractical in many instances. Thus, wider use of passive integrated responders (PIT; microchips) and readers (see O’Shea et al., 2011a,b) for marking bats and the use of telemetry will be necessary. Hayman et al. (2012b) used radio transmitters simply as a method for ‘presence–absence’ detection in a capture–recapture study of migratory E. helvum. Currently, transmitter size limits the use of telemetry in most bat species (Smith et al., 2011), and the range limits the use of PIT tags. Thus, improved micro-technologies are required to reduce the size of the transmitters without compromising battery capacity. These technologies are also valuable to locate the sites bats migrate to or hibernate in.\nMonitoring colony sizes has been of concern for bat ecologists for a number of years, and new technologies are being developed to gain more accurate estimates (e.g. Hristov et al., 2010). These estimates are necessary to test specific hypotheses relating to critical community size, meta-population infection dynamics and coloniality. However, the use of such technologies is still in development, as are the computer algorithms to estimate abundance, and thus, widespread monitoring of colonies is currently very limited.\nInterpretation of infection-related data, such as antibody prevalence, is problematic if the age of the animals sampled is unknown; therefore, better techniques to age bats are required. Hayman et al. (2012a,b) used tooth cementum annuli, but clearly the destructive sampling is not appropriate in the majority of situations. Thus, in the absence of data from individually marked bats, non-destructive sampling from teeth might be a productive area for research (e.g. Plowright et al., 2008a).\nFor better interpretation of infection-related data, immunological tools such as bat-specific reagents, for example, are necessary to be able to understand bat immune responses to infection (whether from field or experimental data). Permissive bat cell lines (e.g. Crameri et al., 2009) may be necessary for isolation of viruses, and experimental studies are necessary to understand the within-host dynamics and pathogenesis of infections in bats and modes of transmission. Highly variable serological responses have been observed among individual bats in experimental studies, meaning interpretation of results is not always straightforward (Turmelle et al., 2010b, Halpin et al., 2011). These experimental studies must be designed to better understand empirical field data (e.g. Sulkin et al., 1960). In particular, baseline estimates of antibody responses from naive bats (e.g. captive bred) are necessary to better interpret serological results from field studies (see Williamson et al., 1998, 2000; Turmelle et al., 2010b). Regarding bat immune responses, typically adaptive responses are measured because tools are available to measure antibody responses. However, substantial advancements in the understanding of bat infection ecology will be made once innate immune responses are understood. This is particularly important for infections such as CoV, filoviruses and henipaviruses, which apparently do not cause overt disease in bats. Cytokine expression profiles, for example, will provide a much deeper understanding of bat immune responses following infection (for an example of methods, see Sadeghi et al., 2011).\nLastly, while suitable statistical and modelling methods exist already, and generally a lack of data is the issue, better use of specific approaches are required. Specifically, increased use of mechanistic models to integrate data from different sources is needed to understand the driver of infection dynamics, and sensitivity analyses should be used once these models have been developed (Restif et al., in press). Consideration of meta-population dynamics and multispecies\/pathogen models may be necessary to understand some systems; however, these models suffer from even greater issues relating to parameterization than single species–single host models. For statistical analysis, use of Bayesian frameworks should be considered when some prior data or knowledge exists and\/or sample sizes are small. Bayesian analysis is often better able to estimate parameters from small data sets than frequentist methods, plus have the flexibility to incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimates (Colchero and Clark, 2012). Both these characteristics may be appropriate for studies of bats when little information is known on a specific species and samples sizes are generally small.","Understanding Anthropogenic Changes\nAlthough human–bat interactions are difficult to quantify, it appears that such interactions are increasing and occurring in numerous ways. Increasingly, humans encroach into bat habitats, and bats are utilizing artificial structures as roosts. Examples of bats utilizing artificial structures include M. myotis (infected with AstV, CoV and AdV) roosting in homes in Europe (Drexler et al., 2011) and RABV-infected T. brasiliensis and E. fuscus bats in bridges and houses in the Americas (Shankar et al., 2005; Turmelle et al., 2010a; O’Shea et al., 2011a,b). CoV-infected E. fuscus have been detected in homes in the United States also (Osborne et al., 2011). Several MARV spillover cases have been linked epidemiologically to cave activities such as tourism and mining (for review, see Towner et al., 2009) and SARS-CoV is believed to have emerged because of the use of bats as food in live ‘wet’ markets in China (Woo et al., 2006). Nipah virus outbreaks have been linked to palm sap collection in Bangladesh and intensification of pig farming, alongside mango (Mangifera indica) production in Malaysia (Luby et al., 2006; Nahar et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2011; Pulliam et al., 2011). Hendra virus outbreaks have been suggested to be attributable to increased urban habituation of bats in Australia (Plowright et al., 2011). Recent surveys suggest that the numbers of harvested Pteropus and Eidolon bats (old world fruit bats) in Asia and Africa can be very high (and likely unsustainable, see Kamins et al., 2011; Struebig et al., 2007; Epstein et al., 2009). The harvested numbers estimated from single regions within nations suggest that human–bat interactions are occurring on an enormous scale throughout both continents. Choisy and Rohani (2006) used theoretical models to predict that in many systems harvesting may increase the prevalence of infection and size of epidemic peaks in populations of harvested animals, because density-dependent recruitment (through increased survival of young) increases the susceptible pool and hence the size of the epidemic peak in populations. These hunting figures, coupled with the increasing use of human-built shelters by bats, mean that the dynamics at the human–bat population interface are a neglected area of research. We believe that this gap must be addressed if we are to understand spillover risk.\nAdditionally, attitudes to bats and bat conservation must be understood to prevent further spillover (Olival et al., 2012). It is encouraging, however, that recent examples appear to demonstrate that if addressed appropriately, mitigation strategies can be implemented (Nahar et al., 2011; Stone, 2011). However, when considering zoonotic infections, bat infection spillover events to humans are typically so infrequent that human effects on spillover dynamics may be difficult to detect. For example, did reduced encroachment and intermediate host contact in Malaysia, because of laws preventing fruit farming in pig farming areas, prevent further NiV outbreaks in Malaysia? In Bangladesh, where NiV outbreaks are almost annual, it may be easier to quantify if preventative measures are successful (Nahar et al., 2011; Stone, 2011). However, neither spillover prevention method may be affecting bat infection dynamics themselves.\nAdvances required to improve the understanding of anthropological effects on infection ecology in bats.Only once well-parameterized models of systems are developed, can perturbations, such as through harvesting or restricting bat movement, be simulated to attempt to predict alterations in infection dynamics. Empirical evidence can be more difficult to produce, in particular because control studies may be difficult to perform, particularly in migratory species, but attempts should be made. Opportunistic (but not poorly designed) studies may be necessary. For example, some agencies are using destructive control methods to eliminate species such as vampire bats to prevent RABV spillover infections in cattle and people. Monitoring population and infection dynamics in both these and untouched populations could provide evidence of increased intensity of epidemics in the local populations, as predicted by Choisy and Rohani (2006). Where culling or hunting occurs in Africa and Asia (Struebig et al., 2007; Epstein et al., 2009; Kamins et al., 2011), studying infection dynamics may be illuminating. Clearly in all cases, studies are necessary for both conservation and infection spillover purposes.\nSummaryUnderstanding disease dynamics in wildlife populations, specifically within populations of bats, is important if informed policy and mitigation strategies are to be taken. The increase in human and bat contact is inevitable; however, there is potential to manage how these interactions occur (Nahar et al., 2011; Stone, 2011). We propose a combination of field and laboratory studies that can be used to create well-validated data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate the aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. This trait-based predictive approach will be particularly important when population surveillance data are unavailable, and it is unclear which aspects of host ecology may be most important in driving potential disease emergence."],"title":"Ecology of Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in Bats: Current Knowledge and Future Directions"}
